<div>
<p>Provisioning is the entire set of operations required to install, configure, and deploy applications product offerings from a system point of view. It performs these operations:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Installation provides the operations related to laying down all the component needed to create an Oracle Fusion Applications environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration tailors components based on the applications topology, the creation of Oracle WebLogic Server Managed Servers and clusters, and the updating of endpoints and virtual hosts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment starts the Managed Servers and clusters and facilitates the actual use of product offerings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This orchestration by a single processing engine ensures that all components interact smoothly and consistently in the applications environment.</p>
<p>The main tasks to be completed when provisioning an Oracle Fusion Applications environment are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Planning</span>: The first step to provisioning an Oracle Fusion Applications environment is planning the environment, specifically its topology, including the number and configuration of hardware units; and its components, including: storage, network, database, Oracle Identity Management, and security configuration. For more information about planning an environment, see <a href="GUID-44A03255-E163-4F45-B835-3A0419DD0353.htm#GUID-44A03255-E163-4F45-B835-3A0419DD0353" title='Planning an Oracle Fusion Applications installation is a prerequisite to a successful install, and may involve a variety of users. To plan the installation fully, it might be necessary to collaborate with database administrators, network engineers, and other specialized administrators within the organization. This material also assumes that at least one person is guiding the installation overall and is taking the role of the "Oracle Fusion Applications Administrator".'>Plan the Topology and Provisioning of the Installation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Preparing</span>: Prior to provisioning an Oracle Fusion Applications environment, hardware and networking components must be prepared and configured, shared disk storage must be set up. The relevant software dependencies must be installed. For more information about preparing components for an installation, see <a href="GUID-6F6F4BD5-1CD3-4234-840D-3C557DCAE3AD.htm#GUID-6F6F4BD5-1CD3-4234-840D-3C557DCAE3AD" title="This section describes the prerequisites for provisioning a new applications environment. Before creating the new environment, review the actions described in the following sections to help ensure a smooth installation.">Prepare for an Installation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Installing Databases</span>: The next step is installing the databases for Oracle Fusion Applications, including the Oracle Identity Management and Oracle Fusion Applications transaction databases. Repository creation utilities are provided to help create the repositories required for an Oracle Fusion Applications environment. For more information about installing the databases for Oracle Fusion Applications, see <a href="GUID-3679765F-5619-4DC4-8D90-37EFB4B5C85B.htm#GUID-3679765F-5619-4DC4-8D90-37EFB4B5C85B" title="This section describes how to install and configure the Oracle Identity Management database repositories.">Install Databases for Oracle Identity Management</a> and <a href="GUID-BC5C918F-9F07-48D4-8C25-ECCB0D6E3996.htm#GUID-BC5C918F-9F07-48D4-8C25-ECCB0D6E3996" title="This section describes how to install and configure a transaction database for use with an Oracle Fusion Applications environment. It also describes the Oracle Fusion Applications Repository Creation Utility (Oracle Fusion Applications RCU), which creates a repository for applications schemas and tablespaces and loads seed data into the database.">Install Oracle Fusion Applications Transaction Database</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Provisioning</span>: After the environment has been planned, prepared, and the relevant databases installed, it is time to provision the Oracle Identity Management and Oracle Fusion Applications environments. The provisioning process installs and configures Oracle Identity Management and Oracle Fusion Applications and all their related components, such as the product offerings to be installed and the applications used to manage, monitor, and troubleshoot an Oracle Fusion Applications environment. Provisioning frameworks are installed to help accomplish this task. For more information about the provisioning procedure, see <a href="GUID-75ACAB64-0C96-452B-921A-6E630CE56D56.htm#GUID-75ACAB64-0C96-452B-921A-6E630CE56D56" title="This section describes the tasks that must be completed to implement Oracle Identity Management Provisioning for both the Single Host and Enterprise (EDG) topologies.">Oracle Identity Management Provisioning</a> and <a href="GUID-CDCEA39A-5053-4B96-BB80-38F776279EA1.htm#GUID-CDCEA39A-5053-4B96-BB80-38F776279EA1" title="This section describes the process of creating a response file for a new Oracle Fusion Applications environment using the Provisioning Wizard interview process.">Create a Response File for a New Oracle Fusion Applications Environment</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Completing Post-Install Tasks</span>: Having provisioned a working Oracle Fusion Applications environment, the next step is completing a set of post-installation tasks. These tasks include a number of required and optional steps, and specific steps required for particular product offerings. For more information about the post-installation tasks, see <a href="GUID-6F299010-45A7-441F-AA4E-8FDA149D9739.htm#GUID-6F299010-45A7-441F-AA4E-8FDA149D9739" title="This section describes the mandatory post-installation tasks to complete before starting working with Oracle Fusion Applications.">Complete Mandatory Post-Installation Tasks</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of provisioning is undertaken by a team composed of various specialists and technicians, each taking on different roles and responsibilities, as discussed in greater detail in <a href="GUID-D30D2572-DE6A-444C-BED8-9E01CB6259B2.htm#GUID-1A0552EE-FE08-453D-8C6A-17DD7AE9A76E">Roles and Responsibilities</a>. All told, a typical installation and provisioning process can take about five to fourteen days, not counting post-installation tasks.</p>

<h2 id="OAINS-GUID-1A0552EE-FE08-453D-8C6A-17DD7AE9A76E" class="sect2"><span class="enumeration_section">1.2</span> Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
<div>
<p>There are a number of roles and responsibilities to be undertaken in the context of provisioning Oracle Fusion Applications. These include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Business sponsor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project manager</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT director</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System administrator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network engineer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database administrator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Identity Management and security specialist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Fusion Applications technical lead or system administrator</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Fusion Applications functional lead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Fusion Applications developer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence and DW reporting specialist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support technician</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Fusion Applications system integrator</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these roles may overlap, and the same individual may fulfill more than one role. For example, many Oracle Fusion Applications technical leads are also database administrators, and an IT director may also act as the project manager for the duration of an Oracle Fusion Applications deployment. Similarly, Oracle Fusion Applications technical leads may inherit support technician duties after most of the deployment tasks have been completed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is common to have a number of people on call to fulfill a particular role. For example, it is typical to have a pool of system or database administrators on call at all times during the course of a deployment, as it is critical for back-end systems to be available and responsive so as to complete technical setup and configuration. For training purposes, several individuals may share principal Oracle Fusion Applications technical or functional Lead responsibilities among themselves.</p>
<p>The mapping of deployment tasks and responsibilities to organizational roles may vary across different types of enterprises depending on corporate culture and organizational structure.</p>

<div>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence is a portfolio of technology and applications comprising an integrated toolset (for querying, reporting, analysis, alerts, mobile analytics, data integration and management, and desktop integration), as well as financial performance management, applications, operational business intelligence applications, and data warehousing.</p>
<p>Typically, Oracle Business Intelligence products are integrated with, and accessible from, other operational applications, such as Oracle Fusion Applications. This integration provides business metrics in the context of an organization's business function and industry.</p>
<p>The Oracle Business Intelligence products integrated with Oracle Fusion Applications include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (Oracle BI EE): A suite of business intelligence tools that delivers a full range of analytic and reporting capabilities.</p>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition is installed and provisioned as part of the Oracle Fusion Applications installation and provisioning process. The BI Provisioning step creates a WebLogic domain, the BI Web application (J2EE) components, and the BI Server and BI Presentation Services, which are deployed on the computer that hosts the domain. The resulting environment is referred to as the "Business Intelligence domain" or "BI Domain."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence Applications: Uses Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse, a unified data repository for all customer-centric data that supports the analytical requirements of Oracle Business Intelligence Applications. Oracle Business Intelligence Applications supplies the warehouse database schema, as well as the logic that extracts data from the Oracle Fusion Applications transactional database and loads it to the warehouse.</p>
<p>The Oracle Fusion Applications installation and provisioning process installs the Oracle BI Applications software components in the Business Intelligence Oracle Home but does no further setup. To finish setting up Oracle BI Applications, follow the instructions in Overview of Functional Configuration in Oracle BI Applications in the <span class="italic">Oracle Business Intelligence Applications Configuration Guide</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence: An ad hoc query and self-service reporting solution offered to all Oracle Fusion Applications customers. Paired with Oracle BI EE, it provides business users with an easy-to-use interface for performing current state analysis of their business applications. Constructed queries and reports are executed in real time against the transactional schema supported by a layer of view objects. This product is configured and deployed during provisioning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Essbase: An online analytical processing (OLAP) server that provides an environment for deploying prepackaged applications or developing custom analytic and enterprise performance management applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher: An enterprise reporting solution for authoring, managing, and delivering reports from multiple data sources in multiple formats via multiple channels.</p>

<div>
<p>Oracle Identity Management enables enterprises to manage the end-to-end life cycle of user identities across all enterprise resources &mdash; both within and beyond the firewall. An installation of Oracle Fusion Applications relies on Oracle Identity Management components to provide web Single Sign-on capability and to act as the policy, credential, and identity store. Although the majority of these components fall within the prerequisite environment, the resource WebGate that acts as the proxy for user authentication must be provisioned along with the applications.</p>
<p>The Oracle Identity Management components required to be present in an Oracle Fusion Applications environment are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Oracle Access Manager (OAM): Manages authentication and authentication policies, including Oracle Single Sign-On, security functions, user self-service, policy management, and delegated administration</p>

<div>
<p>With the Provisioning Wizard question-and-answer interview tool, specify one or more provisioning configurations and collect details associated with the product offerings in those configurations. These responses are the basis for creating a <span class="bold">response file</span>. This response file contains the structural outline of the applications environment topology that are being implemented. To provision the environment, specify the location of the response file and initiate the installation process.</p>
<p>The wizard interview questions fall into the following general areas:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Global and contextual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database configuration and application dependency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared middleware services</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Global and Contextual Questions</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p>These questions set the context and define the focus of the questions to be asked later in the interview. The approach is to progressively refine the scope of the questions, starting with the most generic and narrowing down to a specific path based on the selected provisioning configurations. For example, the <span class="bold">Installation Location</span> screen captures global information about the location of installation and configuration directories, and the <span class="bold">Database Configuration</span> screen records information about the transactional database.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Database Configuration and Application Dependency Questions</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p>The interview is tied directly to the provisioning of one or more product configurations. With the product configuration chosen, the interview guides through the questions related to the product offerings and their dependencies. Dependencies include application and middleware products required by Oracle Fusion Applications, as well as details about the transaction database. For example, the <span class="bold">Domain Topology Configuration</span> screen collects information about the hosts where domains are to be deployed.</p>

<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Shared Middleware Questions</p>

<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p>At the conclusion of the application interview, move to interview questions about middleware services that are shared across domains, for example, the <span class="bold">Web Tier Configuration</span>, <span class="bold">Load Balancer Configuration</span>, <span class="bold">Web Proxy Configuration</span>, <span class="bold">Identity Management Configuration</span>, and <span class="bold">IDM Database Configuration</span> screens.</p>

<div>
<p>During the creation of a response file, select one or more offerings in any of the provisioning configurations listed in the wizard interview. During the actual provisioning process, all application and middleware products (components) associated with the selections are installed, configured, and deployed. However, only the Managed Servers for the product offerings that were selected are started.</p>
<p>Later, to start using an offering that was part of the initial provisioning configuration but has not yet been enabled, navigate to the Oracle Fusion Applications Setup Manager and start the Managed Servers for that offering.</p>
<p>For example, in the Oracle Fusion Customer Relationship Management configuration, there are two product offerings: Oracle Sales and Oracle Marketing. If only Oracle Sales is selected, the Managed Servers for that offering are started when the new environment is provisioned. To enable Oracle Marketing later, use the Oracle Fusion Applications Functional Setup Manager. There is no need to run provisioning a second time.</p>

<div>
<p>Oracle Fusion Applications must be provisioned on multiple hosts for a production deployment and installed from a shared drive that is accessible to all hosts. To properly install all the necessary components for an applications environment on multiple hosts, run the physical installation in phases across all hosts.</p>

<div>
<p>The classification of hosts in a multiple-host environment determines the order in which the installation is run. The following types of hosts are available.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Primordial host</span>: Location of the common domain, specifically the administration server of the common domain. There is one primordial host in each provisioned environment where the administration server of the common domain will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Primary host</span>: Location of the administration server for a domain. Only one primary host exists in a domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Secondary host</span>: Location of the managed servers for any application when they are not on the same host as the administration server of the same domain. This term is typically used along with primary host to differentiate the physical hosts when a domain spans across them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">DMZ host</span>: A host that cannot access the shared storage behind the firewall is said to be in a demilitarized zone (DMZ). Typically used to install Oracle HTTP Server so as to enforce restrictions on communication with components behind the firewall.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div>
<p>Installation actions are completed in phases, across all hosts, in a prescribed phase order. Each phase must be completed on all hosts before running the next phase. For example, the preverify phase must be completed on hosts A, B, and C successfully before running the install phase on any other host. Any one phase can run simultaneously on multiple hosts. For example, run the install phase on hosts A, B, and C simultaneously. Oracle recommends to start the installation on the primordial host.</p>
<p>The provisioning installation phases are as follows (listed in phase order). See <a href="GUID-7273ECF1-DD79-4957-B87B-5260F7968C19.htm#GUID-9A5B262C-65BD-4546-A2BC-234DD8BFA811">Installation Phases and Types of Hosts in a Multiple-Host Environment</a> for complete details.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Install</span>: Installs middleware and applications components and applies database patches shipped with provisioning (for databases created with the wizard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Preconfigure</span>: Updates the Oracle Application Development Framework (Oracle ADF) configuration.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Configure-secondary</span>: Performs the configuration actions on a primary or secondary host (or both), registers Managed Servers with the Node Manager on secondary hosts, and creates a web tier instance. If there are no primary or secondary hosts, or if there are only primary hosts, this phase runs, but takes no action.</p>
</li>

<div>
<p>Before creating a response file for the new Oracle Fusion Applications environment, decide what the topology should look like, including what product offerings to install, port allocations, and the type and number of hosts that are configure in the domains created for the product offerings. For example, Oracle recommends to choose a separate host for each domain that is installed. However, even in that scenario, some large product configurations must be split across multiple hosts.</p>
<p>Determine the necessary system requirements to complete the provisioning of a new environment, based on how the environment is used. For example, if a single instance database is being installed for use as a test system, the requirements differ from the installation of a multi-instance database to use for the production environment. Determine also the access privileges for the database administrator (DBA) or system administrator who performs the provisioning tasks.</p>
<p>Supply directory locations, user names, and passwords associated with the prerequisite installations of Oracle Database and Oracle Identity Management components. These installations must be completed before creating a response file.</p>
