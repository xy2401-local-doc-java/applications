                  <p>The goal library is a repository of
                     reusable goals that you create and maintain to manage the enterprise
                     goal-setting process efficiently. HR specialists create performance goals that are used by Goal
                     Management, Performance Management, and Talent Review work areas,
                     and development goals used by Career Development, Talent Review, and
                     Succession Management work areas.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Organization owners, managers, and workers can search the
                     goal library to copy the goals. Managers and HR specialists can assign
                     the goals through goal plans in the Goal Management work area, to
                     a selected population. Use the goal library to define goals consistently
                     and reduce the effort of creating a new goal if similar goals already
                     exist. To add goals from the goal library, organization owners, managers,
                     and workers can search for goals using different criteria such as
                     goal name, type, and status. HR specialists add a goal to the goal
                     library by using the Manage Goal Library task:

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Adding Goals</h3>
                     
                     <p>HR specialists add goals to the library, specify their
                        goal type and determine their attributes, including: name, description,
                        success criteria, target completion date, and more. They can use the
                        External ID attribute to refer to a performance goal in external applications.
                        This attribute value is either application-generated or user-defined
                        based on the application configurations. In addition to the goal type,
                        they can also decide the subtype of a goal. A subtype is a method
                        for further classifying a goal within a goal type. Subtypes are configured
                        and extended based on business requirements. They can also add target outcomes, if
                        available, to the goal. When managers or workers copy a goal, they
                        can change the goal attributes as appropriate. 
                     </p>

                        If HR specialists create goals anywhere except the
                        goal library, such as in a performance document, the Goals page, or
                        talent review, the application doesn't add these goals to the goal
                        library. You can view such goals from the worker's portrait and on
                        all other pages where the goal is included except in the goal library.

                     <p>You can edit a goal in the goal library at any time,
                        regardless of whether people have already copied the goal. Changes
                        that you make to goals in the library don't affect those that have
                        been copied and are in current use, because there is no link between
                        the two versions of the goal. You can't edit the external ID for a
                        goal.

                     <p>By default, the status of a goal you create is set
                        to <span class="uicontrol">Active</span> to make it available
                        to copy. You can set the status of a goal to <span class="uicontrol">Inactive</span>, even if the goal has been copied and is currently
                        being used by workers. If you change the status of the goal to inactive,
                        then it's no longer available for copying. You can make the goal inactive,
                        for example, to edit it, then restore it to <span class="uicontrol">Active</span> status to make the edited goal available again.
                     </p>

                        make goals available to a role. By default, all roles have access
                        to the goal. You can decide whether to give access to the goal only
                        to HR specialists, or also include managers and workers.
