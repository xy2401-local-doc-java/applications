                  <p>The Career Development work area uses predefined
                     content types Licenses and Certifications, Competencies, and Languages
                     as target outcomes. Target outcomes are content types that contain content items and maintained in
                     the Profiles work area. Target outcomes help workers add or improve
                     requisite skills, competencies, certifications, or other qualifications. Depending on content section
                     access settings for your role, you can add target outcomes to performance
                     goals. You add target outcomes to increase a worker's performance
                     on the current job. You add target outcomes to development goals to develop
                     the current role, or prepare for a future role. You can also add a
                     goal to a competency from the competency gap chart. This competency
                     is saved as the target outcome for the goal.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To use Licenses and Certifications, Competencies,
                     or Languages content type as a target outcome in the Career Development
                     work area:

                        <p>The relevant subscriber code must
                           be used to access the Profiles functional area from the Career Development
                           work area.

                        <p>Your role must have access to the

                           abstract role by using the Manage Profile Content Section Access task
                           in the Setup and Maintenance work area.

                           a relationship with the content type. You add a relationship between
                           the Goals content type and the corresponding content type in the Profiles
                           work area.

                  <p> After a worker completes a development goal, the
                     worker's person profile is updated to include the content item that the target outcome addresses.
                     If the content type exists in the worker's person profile, the profile
                     is updated to include new or changed information. You enable target
                     outcomes by selecting the Target Outcomes feature choice available under
                     the Workforce Development offering on the Configure Offerings page
                     in the Setup and Maintenance work area.

                     <p>If allowed, you can add target outcomes to goals
                        when adding or editing development goals for workers. You can select
                        target outcomes from the available list of content types competencies,
                        languages, and licenses and certifications only. The content types
                        available to you depend on the content section access settings for
                        your role.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Career Development work area displays a competency
                        gap chart, a graphical representation of how well your competency
                        ratings match the required proficiency ratings of a role (job or position
                        profile), in the Explore Roles infotile on a worker's Career Development
                        page. The application generates a competency gap chart for each explored
                        role by using only those competencies that appear in both your current
                        role and the role you select as a recommended role or career of interest.
                        Use the competency gap chart to determine whether you're already qualified
                        for the selected job role, or if areas exist where you need further
                        development. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you identify gaps, you can add a goal for the
                        competency for which you have lesser ratings. For example, if your
                        rating for the Leadership competency is 3 and the targeted rating
                        for that competency in the Product Manager job is 4, you can add a
                        goal to the Leadership competency to help you improve your leadership
                        capabilities. If the job profile contains fewer than three competencies,
                        then the competency gap chart is displayed as a bar chart. Otherwise,
                        the chart is displayed as a radar chart. The competency for which
                        you add a goal appears as a target outcome for that goal.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If allowed, you can also add target outcomes to goals
                        when:
                     </p>

                     <p>When the development goal is completed, and approved
                        if approvals are required, then the worker's person profile is updated
                        to include the target outcomes. For content items that require a rating
                        level, such as competencies, the manager must select a rating level,
                        which is the rating level associated with the content item. If approvals
                        aren't enabled for completing the percentage completion of a goal,
                        the worker can also rate the competency associated with the goal.
                        The evaluation type displayed for the competency is Self when the
                        worker rates the competency.

                        the evaluation type, the user who rated the worker's competency can
                        delete or update the rating on the worker's person profile even after

                        The development goals must be in the goal library. Goals from the talent
                        pool appear automatically in the goals of talent pool members, who
                        can access them from their development plan on the My Career Development
                        page. Managers can access these goals in the Career Development work
                        area. Workers don't inherit goals from the talent pool if they already
                        have them.

                        When you add a worker to a talent pool, the worker
                        doesn't automatically inherit any goals already associated with the
                        talent pool. The worker inherits development goals that you add to
                        the talent pool after the worker becomes a member.
