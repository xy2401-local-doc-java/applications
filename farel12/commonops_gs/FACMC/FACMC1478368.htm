                     <p>After the download completes, you can modify data
                        in cells with a white background. The workbook displays a symbol in
                        the <span class="uicontrol">Changed</span> cell to mark the
                        rows where you modified or entered data in one of the white cells.
                        You can only enter values in amount columns. You cannot enter or change
                        a value in a percentage column. When you upload the workbook, the
                        application recalculates the percentage of eligible salary column
                        based on the compensation amount you entered in the workbook.

                        column uses to calculate a value, the calculated value does not automatically
                        update. After you upload the workbook, the application recalculates
                        dynamic calculations and fast formulas when the page refreshes. You
                        must configure the dynamic calculations and fast formulas to reevaluate
                        when data changes on the worksheet.
