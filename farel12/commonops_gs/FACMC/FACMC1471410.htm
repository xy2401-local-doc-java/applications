                        and cycle you select. If the process finds Maria eligible for the
                        compensation plan, it adds her to the appropriate manager's worksheet.

                     <p>Michael was ineligible for a compensation plan because

                        the compensation cycle starts. When you reprocess Michael, the process
                        reevaluates his eligibility based on the corrected data. If it finds
                        Michael eligible, it adds him to the appropriate manager's worksheet.

                        for a compensation award. When you reprocess Janice, the process reevaluates
                        her eligibility, finds her ineligible, and removes Janice from her

                     <p>Ravi, a contingent worker, is not eligible to receive
                        compensation when a cycle starts, but manages workers who are eligible.
                        At this time his processing status is <span class="uicontrol">Limited</span>, which allows him only to allocate compensation and approve lower
                        managers' worksheets. A few weeks later, Ravi becomes a regular worker
                        and is now eligible to receive compensation. When you reprocess Ravi,
                        the process reevaluates his eligibility and finds him eligible. Ravi's
                        eligibility status changes to <span class="uicontrol">Eligible</span> and the process adds him to the appropriate manager's worksheet.

                     <h3>What's the difference between primary worksheet managers, secondary managers, and other reviewers?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Primary worksheet managers are the worksheet
                        owners responsible for the final compensation allocated to eligible
                        workers, commonly the supervisors of the workers who appear on the
                        worksheets. Each manager in the primary hierarchy receives a worksheet
                        to allocate compensation to his directs and indirect reports. Primary
                        managers manage budgets and submit their worksheets for approval up
                        the approval hierarchy.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Secondary worksheet managers can view compensation
                        information for workers available to them, including workers at lower
                        levels in the hierarchy. Secondary worksheet managers are not necessarily
                        the workers' primary worksheet managers but can be. Depending on how
                        the plan is configured, the secondary managers can update and propose
                        compensation and save their worksheet. Or they can only view allocations
                        proposed by the primary worksheet manager.  They don't submit worksheets
                        for approval. Primary worksheet managers consider secondary managers'
                        proposed allocations and may include them when they submit their worksheets.

                     <p>Other reviewers are people who are delegated
                        one or more workers by primary worksheet managers. Other reviewers
                        have access similar to secondary managers, but the review hierarchy
                        is only one level.

                        When a person isn't eligible for a plan but has at least one subordinate
                        worker who is eligible, the person's eligibility is <span class="uicontrol">Limited</span>. The person can manage budgets and

                        the person to a manager's worksheet and makes the person eligible
                        to receive compensation.
