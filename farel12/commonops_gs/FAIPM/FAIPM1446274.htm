                     <p>You create eligibility profiles to match the
                        business requirements for your performance evaluation business process.
                        For example, you can create eligibility profiles to evaluate workers
                        in a specific department, job, location, or other criteria. You can
                        also combine criteria. For example, you can create a performance document
                        to evaluate every person in the Sales department who is a manager
                        level 3, and located in California. You can either create one eligibility
                        profile with those three criteria, or create three separate profiles
                        with each criterion. You create eligibility profiles using the Manage
                        Talent Eligibility Profiles task in the Setup and Maintenance and
                        Performance Management work areas.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>When creating an eligibility profile for performance
                        documents, you can select any profile usage. However, because eligibility
                        for a performance document is determined by assignment, you must select <span class="uicontrol">Specific assignment</span> as the assignment to
                        use. <span class="uicontrol">Specific assignment</span> is automatically
                        selected if you first select <span class="uicontrol">Performance</span> as the profile usage. Then, when the eligibility process is run,
                        it evaluates every assignment for a worker to determine which, if
                        any, performance documents the worker is eligible to use for each
                        assignment.

                     <p>When a worker is eligible for a performance
                        document, it appears on the My Manager Evaluations page of that worker's
                        direct manager, along with documents that aren't associated with eligibility
                        profiles. Managers can view performance documents for which their
                        direct or indirect reports, or workers for whom they are the document
                        manager (such as for a project), are eligible. The document also appears
                        on the worker's My Evaluations page. Both the worker and manager can
                        access the document.

                        no longer eligible for the document, that document disappears from
                        the My Evaluations page for that worker. Neither the worker nor the
