                     <p>You can create as many roles as required for
                        the evaluation process that your organization employs. For example,
                        you might have roles such as peer or mentor, or additional managers
                        as part of a matrix management review. Every role that you create
                        is classified as a participant role type.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>To enable the role you create to view ratings and
                        comments submitted by workers, managers, and other participants, select <span class="uicontrol">Allow role to view worker and manager evaluations</span>. For participants with this role, they can view all ratings, comments,
                        and questionnaires submitted by all other roles when they open the
                        performance document from the My Feedback Requests page.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The manager and worker roles are required; you can't
                        delete or edit them. You can, however, create performance templates
                        that don't require either the manager or worker role to answer a questionnaire
                        or rate workers. In this case, you must add the role names to the
                        template to permit the manager or worker to view feedback.

                     <p>Along with the role name, you can add a description
                        for the role. The description appears on the Manage Participant Feedback
                        pages to assist users in determining which role to assign to each

                        on questionnaires. You must select the roles in the performance template

                        questionnaire for each performance document within a performance period.
                        However, you can assign more than one role to participants so they
                        can complete more than one questionnaire. You associate roles with
                        the questionnaires that the role uses in the performance template.
                        You assign roles to participants using the Manage Participant Feedback
                        task in the Performance Management work area.

                  <p>The Manage Participant Feedback task enables
                     individuals other than the line manager and worker to provide direct feedback into
                     the worker's performance document. Additional roles providing feedback
                     might include peers, mentors, customers, and other managers, such
                     as matrix managers. The additional roles providing feedback are called
                     participants. Participants can evaluate workers on content items by
                     providing ratings, comments, or both, and respond to a questionnaire to provide a 360-degree
                     evaluation. Participant feedback is recorded as part of the official
                     performance evaluation. By including a variety of participants who
                     have worked to some capacity with the worker, the manager can obtain
                     a broader view of the worker's performance to assist in the evaluation.

                     <p>Managers and workers can track participant feedback
                        to monitor its status to see whether it's started, in progress, or
                        completed. Depending on configuration, workers can also see the feedback
                        itself and the names of the participants who provided the feedback.

                     <p>Managers and workers can remove a participant from
                        a performance evaluation, or change the role (for example, change
                        a mentor to a peer), provided the participant hasn't yet provided
                        feedback.

                     <p>HR specialists create the participant roles
                        that can rate worker competencies, goals, overall performance, and
                        answer questionnaires. They can configure a role that allows participants
                        also to view ratings, comments, and questionnaires provided by the
                        worker, other managers, and participants. In the performance template,
                        the HR specialist selects the roles that can provide feedback in the
                        Profile Content (Competencies), Goals, and Overall Summary sections.
                        The HR specialist can associate separate questionnaire templates,
                        with different questions, to each role.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Managers and workers, if permitted, can select participants
                        of varying roles to provide feedback and notify them to provide feedback.
                        The managers and workers can add the same participant more than once
                        to a performance document. They can select the same role or a different
                        one for the participant. The participant responds to the questionnaires
                        associated with the roles, even if the questionnaires are the same.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Participants can't add or edit content, such as competencies
                        or goals in the performance document, unlike managers and workers.

                     <p>Participants, as well as managers and workers,
                        provide feedback by answering questions about the worker on a questionnaire
                        that the HR specialist adds to the performance document in the performance
                        template. The questionnaire is a performance template section, and
                        appears as a tab in the performance document, just as do other sections,
                        such as the Goals or Overall Summary sections.

                     <p>The manager and worker, if allowed, can add questions
                        they create to the questionnaire that's provided for the performance
                        document. They can add questions only to the questionnaires that are
                        associated with the participant roles they select. You must also configure
                        the questionnaire to allow them to add additional questions.

                        Manage Questionnaire Templates and Manage Questionnaires tasks in
                        the Setup and Maintenance work area.

                        can configure the performance template so that participants can provide
                        overall comments about the worker instead of answering questions on
                        the questionnaire. Participants can't view ratings, comments, or questionnaire

                        so the worker can't view participant feedback, the worker can't print
                        it.
