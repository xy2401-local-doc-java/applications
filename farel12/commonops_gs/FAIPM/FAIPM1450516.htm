                     <p>The Performance and Potential box chart requires both
                        a performance rating model you select, and the predefined potential
                        rating model. For the Potential rating model, you must configure the
                        attributes of the rating model, but you cannot create and use a different
                        one for the box chart. You configure rating models using the Manage
                        Profile Rating Models task is the Setup and Maintenance work area.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>To create the box labels for the Performance and
                        Potential box chart, you must first select the performance rating
                        model to associate with the box chart. Use the Manage Performance
                        and Potential Box Chart Labels task in the Setup and Maintenance or
                        Performance Management work areas to create and update box chart labels.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Select the rating model specified in the performance
                        templates for the overall rating of the Overall Summary section. This
                        ensures that the box chart displays the data from the performance documents created
                        from the templates. The default performance rating model is the one
                        selected in the <span class="uicontrol">Default Rating Model for
                           Performance Management Analytics</span> profile option.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> If you create a performance template that uses another
                        rating model for the Overall Summary section, you must:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Associate another box chart with
                              that rating model
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Create labels for that box chart</p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p> This setup ensures that the data appears in the
                        analytic on the My Organization page.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The performance rating model you select is used along
                        the x-axis to plot performance ratings. The analytic graph uses the
                        potential rating model defined in Oracle Fusion Profile Management
                        for the y-axis to plot potential ratings. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The number of cells that appear on the analytic depends
                        on the rating categories defined for the rating models you use in
                        the analytic. The number of cells is calculated by multiplying the
                        number of rating categories defined for the potential rating model
                        by the number of rating categories for the performance rating model.
                        For example, if each rating model has three rating categories, the
                        total number of cells is: 3 x 3, or 9. If the potential rating model
                        has four rating categories and the performance rating model has three,
                        the total of cells is: 4 x 3, or 12.
                     </p>

                     <p>Performance ratings are collected from performance
                        documents. The performance rating is the overall rating supplied by
                        the manager in the Overall Summary section of the most recently completed
                        performance document.

                     <p>Managers rate worker potential ratings using the Career
                        Planning tab in Person Spotlight and during a talent review, which could be the
                        most recent potential rating in the worker's profile. Performance
                        and potential ratings are maintained in Oracle Fusion Profile Management.

                        describe the level. For example, if the performance and potential
                        rating models for the graphic display low ratings in the lower left
                        of the grid, you could name the lower left cell Novice. The upper
                        right cell that contains highest performers could be called Top Talent.
