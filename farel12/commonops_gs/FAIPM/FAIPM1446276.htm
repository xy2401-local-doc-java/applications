                     <p>After you select the tasks to include as part
                        of the process flow, you can change the task sequence. Some tasks
                        are logical in sequence. For example, it's likely that you would place
                        the Set Goals task before the Worker Self-Evaluation and Manager Evaluation
                        of Worker tasks, and those before the First Approval task. However,
                        you may decide not to use all of those tasks. Your enterprise may
                        not require the Set Goals task, and let workers and managers add goals
                        and competencies to the performance document as part of the evaluation
                        tasks.

                     <p>Other tasks have more flexibility. For example, you
                        may want to schedule the Share Document task either before, or after,
                        the First Approval task, depending on when you prefer to let workers
                        see the manager ratings.

                     <p>During the performance evaluation, all tasks must
                        be completed by the role that performs the task before the next task
                        can be started, even if the same role performs both tasks. 
                     </p>

                        at any time, as long as the performance document template for the

                     <p>The company has a special project for a group of workers
                        to deliver a new module within six months for their existing mobile
                        application to beat a competitor. ABC Company wants to perform a simplified
                        review of the workers who worked on this important project. The workers
                        are also subject to the annual performance evaluation in a few months.
                     </p>
                     <p>For the project review, the following applies:</p>
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>

                              and the reviews as part of the Manager Evaluates Worker task.

                           <p>Workers aren't required to provide
                              any goals or perform a self-evaluation on the project so they can
                              continue to concentrate on their work responsibilities.

                              with the workers because the workers are required to acknowledge that
                              they reviewed the manager ratings.

                  <p>The manager and worker can evaluate the worker
                     concurrently during the performance evaluation when the performance document is configured to allow it. With concurrent evaluations, managers
                     and workers can perform their respective worker evaluation tasks simultaneously
                     or at different times. In either case, the managers and workers can
                     provide ratings and comments, and add additional content to the performance
                     document until they complete and submit the document. This allows,
                     for example, managers to start working on the evaluation before the
                     workers complete it.

                        can be performed concurrently, the document is structured so the worker
                        must complete the self-evaluation task first, or the manager must
                        complete the evaluate worker task first. Typically, performance documents
                        require the worker to complete the self-evaluation task first.

                        The Manage Participant Feedback Task can be performed
                        concurrently with the Worker Self-Evaluation and Manager Evaluation
                        of Worker tasks. It's completed when the manager submits the performance
                        document or locks the feedback to prevent any participants from providing
                        additional feedback. The application permits the Manage Participation
                        Feedback task to be completed whether or not any participants submitted
                        feedback.

                              flow is Completed. Not Started, by contrast, indicates the task hasn't
                              been started and isn't ready to be started as the status of the previous

                              the analytic Task Completion Status.

                     <p>You can set up approvals for performance documents to
                        include multiple approval tasks, and a hierarchy of approvers. When
                        the manager or worker submits the document for approval, approvers
                        receive notification that the document is ready for approval, and
                        they can approve or reject the document in multiple locations.

                        <p>To use approvals, you must configure the process flow to include
                           an approval task. You set up process flows using the Manage Performance
                           Process Flows task in the Setup and Maintenance work area. You can
                           set up process flows to require one, two, or no approval tasks. If
                           you include approval tasks, you can place them in whatever order your
                           business process requires. For example, you might want to create a
                           process flow with the First Approval task after the Manager Performs
                           Worker Evaluation task, and the Second Approval after the Final Feedback
                           task.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When each approval task is reached, the manager must
                           submit the performance document for approval, even if the worker performs
                           the task before the approval task. The document goes through the entire
                           approval process so all required approvers must approve the document
                           before the evaluation continues.

                           manager of the manager of the worker being evaluated. However, you
                           can add additional levels of approvers and other roles, such as HR
                           specialist. Other roles must have the correct privilege for approvals
                           and a data security profile that lets that includes access to the
                           worker whose performance document they're asked to approve. You set
                           up approvals and the associated notifications on the Manage Approval
                           Rules and Notifications page. To add the HR specialist as an approver,
                           you must also add an area of responsibility for the HR specialist
                           using the Manage Areas of Responsibility task in the Person Management
                           work area. Both pages are found in the Setup and Maintenance work

                           document so the approver can view it. When all approvers have approved
                           or rejected the document, the worker's manager receives notification
                           whether the document was approved or rejected. The approval process
                           is repeated if a manager resubmits a document after rejection, or
                           a second approval task is configured in the process flow.

                        multiple locations. They can also perform other actions, such as requesting
                        more information, or reassigning or delegating the approval to another
                        manager. Human resource (HR) specialists can bypass the approval task
                        for performance documents.
