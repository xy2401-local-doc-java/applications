                     <p>A matrix manager is a manager of a type other than
                        line manager (for example, project manager, team manager, functional
                        manager). You add manager types to workers using the Manage Employment
                        task in the Person Management work area.

                        In some cases, the line manager might not be the
                        manager who controls the performance document. In
                        this topic, the line manager is assumed to be the performance document
                        manager.

                     <p>In a performance evaluation, matrix managers are
                        participants with a specific configured role that gives them the added
                        ability to view ratings and comments submitted by others. You create
                        the performance role using the Manage Performance Roles task in the
                        Setup and Maintenance work area.

                        template. They can't add or remove content items, such as competencies

                     <p>When the worker submits the completed self-evaluation,
                        matrix managers receive notification, if that notification option
                        is enabled. The matrix manager accesses the document from the My Feedback
                        Requests tab in the Performance Management work area. You set up the
                        Performance Management notifications in the Setup and Maintenance
                        work area.

                        (and workers, if configured to do so), can view the names of the matrix
                        managers.

                     <p>They can add matrix managers as participants to evaluation
                        on the same page. Line managers can also remove matrix managers, even
                        if they were automatically assigned. If the line manager or worker
                        adds a matrix manager as a reviewer, they must send a notification
                        to alert the matrix manager that the document is available for
                        review.

                     Matrix managers can then access performance documents on
