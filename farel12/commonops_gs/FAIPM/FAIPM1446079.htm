                  <p>To create a performance document you
                     need a performance template. The performance template contains a document
                     type, template sections, and a process flow. Create these either
                     when creating the performance template, or select previously-configured

                     <p>Sections form the structure of a performance document.
                        The sections support the process flow used by the template.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the sections you configure the types of content
                        that can be rated and the processing options for ratings. You also
                        determine the sources of content, and how the performance documents
                        integrate with profiles and Oracle Fusion Goal Management goals. Sections
                        can also contain options for managers and workers to provide final
                        feedback about the evaluation.

                     <p>Create process flows to determine which tasks workers,
                        managers, and participants perform as part of the evaluation process.
                        For example, you can include tasks to set goals, let managers and
                        participants evaluate workers, and workers evaluate themselves. You
                        can create as many process flows as required to correspond to the
                        different evaluation requirements of your enterprise.
                     </p>
                     <p>The process flow dictates which sections are required
                        for the performance template. For example, if the process flow includes
                        the task for managers to rate workers, you must set up Profile Content
                        or Goals sections where managers can rate workers on competencies
                        or goals, or an Overall Summary section where managers provide an
                        overall rating.

                     <p>When created, the performance document may contain
                        competencies that the performance template is configured to provide.
                        These can include competencies from the content library or from the
                        worker's job profile. During the evaluation process workers and managers
                        can add additional competencies from the content library They can
                        also update the performance document to reflect any changes in job
                        competencies, to the document to ensure that they have the most recent
                        content. The ability to add and update competencies from these sources
                        depends on the settings for the template used to generate the performance
                        document.

                     <p>To update competencies in the performance document,
                        they use the <span class="uicontrol">Update Goals and Competencies</span> action on the pages used to evaluate the worker or set document
                        content. However, they must remove previously-added competencies manually
                        from the performance document.

                        document applies are added. Competencies associated with profiles
                        for which the worker has another active performance document  are
                        not added. However, managers and workers can add these competencies
                        directly to the performance document by adding them from the content

                        Any attachments to goals are also displayed in the performance document.
                        The performance goal details held in performance documents and the
                        Goal Management component have some differences:

                              manager provide in the performance document aren't available on the
                              Goal Management pages.
                           </p>
                        </li>

                              Management pages are added to the performance document only when the
                              goal is initially added to the document; afterward, weights are maintained
                              independently.
                           </p>
                        </li>

                              Comments region of the performance document do not show on the goal
                              management pages; however comments from the Goal Management pages
                              appear in the performance document.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>Workers and managers can add performance goals on
                        the Goal Management pages and the goals are pulled into the workers'
                        performance documents when the documents are created. Goal plans are
                        required to manage goals in Goal Management. The goals in a goal plan
                        associated with the review period and document type selected for the
                        performance document appear in the document when it's created.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When managers or workers edit the worker's existing
                        goals in Goal Management, the changes are reflected in the performance
                        document when it's opened. To copy new goals into the performance
                        document from the goal management business process they must use the
                        Update Goals and Competencies action in the performance document.
                        The Update Goals and Competencies action creates a new goal, but copies
                        its key attributes from an existing goal in another performance document.
                        The action is found on the pages used to evaluate the worker or set
                        document content. Goals are not automatically removed from the performance
                        document and must be manually removed.
                     </p>
