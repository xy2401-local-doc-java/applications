                     <p>As an HR specialist, you create and manage review periods by using the Manage
                        Review Periods task. You can open the task: 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>In the Related Links panel on the
                              Tasks tab on the My Goals page in the Goals work area 
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>On the Tasks tab on the My Evaluations
                              page in the Performance work area
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>In the Setup and Maintenance work
                              area
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Each review period must have a unique name. You can
                        create review periods any time, and later associate them with goal
                        plans, goal plan sets (if enabled), and performance documents. If
                        a review period is in use by a business object, then you can't modify
                        the start and end dates of the review period. The application also
                        adds the tag In Use to the review period next to the Status attribute
                        on the Edit Review Period page. If the review period isn't used by
                        any business objects, the application adds the tag Not in Use.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can set the review period status to active or
                        inactive any time. The business objects already associated with an
                        inactive review period will still use the review period. Inactive
                        review periods are no longer visible to HR specialists when creating
                        a business object, such as a goal plan, goal plan set, or performance
                        document. Workers can't view inactive review periods on the application
                        pages.
                     </p>

                     Documents with Review Periods</h3>
                     
                     <p>You create review periods to associate with goal
                        plans and performance documents that fall within the review period
                        dates. In the performance template, you select the review period to
                        associate with a performance period from which the performance document
                        is created. This enables you to connect an employee's performance
                        evaluation with progress towards a performance goal in a goal plan
                        within a business cycle. If goal plan sets are enabled, you must also
                        associate review period with sets within the review period time frame,
                        thereby, associating all goal plans within a goal plan set with the
                        selected review period.
