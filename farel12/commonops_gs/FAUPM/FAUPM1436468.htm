                        content. The ability to add and update competencies from these sources

                        content. However, they must remove previously-added competencies manually

                        for which the worker has another active performance document  are
                        not added. However, managers and workers can add these competencies

                              Management pages are added to the performance document only when the
                              goal is initially added to the document; afterward, weights are maintained
                              independently.

                              appear in the performance document.

                     <p>Workers and managers can add performance goals on
                        the Goal Management pages and the goals are pulled into the workers'
                        performance documents when the documents are created. Goal plans are
                        required to manage goals in Goal Management. The goals in a goal plan
                        associated with the review period and document type selected for the
                        performance document appear in the document when it's created.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When managers or workers edit the worker's existing
                        goals in Goal Management, the changes are reflected in the performance
                        document when it's opened. To copy new goals into the performance
                        document from the goal management business process they must use the
                        Update Goals and Competencies action in the performance document.
                        The Update Goals and Competencies action creates a new goal, but copies
                        its key attributes from an existing goal in another performance document.
                        The action is found on the pages used to evaluate the worker or set
                        document content. Goals are not automatically removed from the performance
                        document and must be manually removed.

                  <p>Using the Manage Participant Feedback task,
                     managers and workers can request and view participant feedback and
                     monitor participant feedback status. Participant feedback enables
                     people other than the worker, or the worker's manager, to provide
                     ratings and comments on worker overall performance, competencies, and goals, and respond to a questionnaire.
                     The availability of participant feedback and which roles can perform
                     the tasks are determined by the configuration of the performance document by
                     the human resource (HR) specialist. The Manage Participant Feedback
                     task is available from the My Manager Evaluations and My Evaluations
                     pages in the Performance Management work area.

                  <p>Managers can manage participant feedback for a performance
                     document for any person whose performance document they're managing,
                     such as direct reports, or workers for whom they're managing a particular
                     document. Typically these are direct reports, but could also include,
                     for example, workers who work on particular projects for another manager.
                     A worker manages participant feedback only for participants who provide
                     feedback about the worker.

                        a participant more than once for the same document, either using the
                        same role or another role. If a minimum number is required, it's only
                        a guideline; the task can be completed without the minimum required

                     <p>You can remove participants from the list before the

                        has saved or submitted feedback only the HR specialist can remove
                        the participant and feedback.

                        directly to participants if allowed. Otherwise, when the worker clicks
                        the <span class="uicontrol">Send Request</span> button, the manager
                        is notified of the request, and the participant name appears on the
                        manager's Manage Participant Feedback page. The manager then sends
                        the request to the participant.

                        and the request is added to the Performance Manager and Performance
                        Worker Overview pages. There, the participant can select a link to
                        open the performance document and begin providing feedback.

                        prevent participants from accessing the performance document to start
                        or continue providing feedback. Managers can do this, for example,
                        when they have sufficient feedback to complete their evaluations of
                        workers, or they have more participants than required. Once locked,
                        the feedback request can't be unlocked.

                        if the participant is a manger or worker. If the manager decides to
                        gather more feedback from the participant, the manager or worker must
                        issue another request for feedback to the participant.

                  <p>Managers use the Writing Assistant feature
                     to assist them in writing useful comments in the performance documents of
                     workers during a performance evaluation. The Writing Assistant provides
                     suggestions that are associated with competencies and their correlated
                     proficiency levels to managers. The suggestions help managers describe
                     observed worker actions, and those workers aspire to perform.

                     <p>In a performance evaluation, matrix managers are
                        participants with a specific configured role that gives them the added
                        ability to view ratings and comments submitted by others. You create
                        the performance role using the Manage Performance Roles task in the
                        Setup and Maintenance work area.

                     <p>When the worker submits the completed self-evaluation,
                        matrix managers receive notification, if that notification option

                        Requests tab in the Performance Management work area. You set up the
                        Performance Management notifications in the Setup and Maintenance

                        (and workers, if configured to do so), can view the names of the matrix
                        managers.

                     <p>They can add matrix managers as participants to evaluation
                        on the same page. Line managers can also remove matrix managers, even
                        if they were automatically assigned. If the line manager or worker
                        adds a matrix manager as a reviewer, they must send a notification
                        to alert the matrix manager that the document is available for
                        review.

                        the worker to evaluate after the worker submits the document. During
                        the Manager Evaluation of Workers task, the manager can add content
                        items to the performance document and click <span class="uicontrol">Return to Worker</span> on the document.

                        administrative task to reopen the performance document for the worker
                        after adding items to it. Or, after adding content items, the manager
                        can ask the human resource (HR) specialist to perform the Update Performance
                        Tasks task to move the document back to an earlier task.

                        items and the evaluation continues from that point. The Reset Evaluation
                        Status and Update Performance Tasks administrative tasks are performed
                        in the Performance Management worker area, where you also open performance
                        documents.
