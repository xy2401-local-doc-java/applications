                     <p>Your organization

                        from San Francisco to Beijing midway through the year. After she leaves,
                        you run the eligibility batch process, making her ineligible to use
                        the performance document for San Francisco-based workers. However,
                        your organization's business processes state that she should be evaluated
                        using the performance documents appropriate for both locations as
                        she spent the minimum number of months required at each. Use the <span class="uicontrol">Force eligible</span> option for the <span class="uicontrol">Change Eligibility</span> action to change the San
                        Francisco-based document from ineligible to eligible again. The worker

                        Evaluation of Workers task in a reopened document changes to <span class="uicontrol">In progress</span>, as does the status of the performance
                        document. The manager can then complete the task. If there is no Manager
                        Evaluation of Workers task, the Worker Self-Evaluation task status
                        changes to In Progress so the worker can complete the task. In both
                        cases, the statuses of subsequent tasks in the process flow change
                        to Not Started, and the evaluation can continue following the tasks
                        configured for the performance document. When you reopen a document,
                        all existing ratings, comments, and content items remain unchanged
                        from before the document was reopened.

                     <p>To locate eligible documents, the HR specialist and
                        manager can search using worker name, performance document name, or
                        both. HR specialists can reopen multiple documents at one time; line
                        managers can only reopen one at a time.

                     <p>To reset a completed worker self-evaluation task
                        so the worker can access the task again, the manager can use the Reset
                        Evaluation Status page. The manager can also reset the worker evaluation
                        using the <span class="uicontrol">Reset Evaluation Status</span> button on the performance document. Using either method, the manager
                        resets the status of the Worker Self-Evaluation task to In Progress,
                        and the worker can access the performance document to continue the
                        evaluation. The statuses of subsequent tasks change to Not Started.
                        The status of the performance document changes to In Progress. When
                        you reset the task, all existing ratings, comments, and content items
                        remain unchanged.
