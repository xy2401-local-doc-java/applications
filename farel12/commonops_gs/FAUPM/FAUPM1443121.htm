                  <h2>Performance Document Components: How They Work Together</h2>
                  <p>To create a performance document you
                     need a performance template. The performance template contains a document
                     type, template sections, and a process flow. Create these either
                     when creating the performance template, or select previously-configured
                     ones. 
                  </p>
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAUPM106216"><h3 class="topictitle">Document Types</h3>
                     <p>Document types categorize the types of performance
                        documents that are valid for an organization, such as an annual evaluation,
                        a semiannual evaluation, a project evaluation, and so on. You set
                        the dates to determine the time period that a document type is valid.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAUPM106217"><h3 class="topictitle">Performance Template Sections</h3>
                     <p>Sections form the structure of a performance document.
                        The sections support the process flow used by the template.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the sections you configure the types of content
                        that can be rated and the processing options for ratings. You also
                        determine the sources of content, and how the performance documents
                        integrate with profiles and Oracle Fusion Goal Management goals. Sections
                        can also contain options for managers and workers to provide final
                        feedback about the evaluation. 
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAUPM106218"><h3 class="topictitle">Process Flows for the Evaluation Process</h3>
                     <p>Create process flows to determine which tasks workers,
                        managers, and participants perform as part of the evaluation process.
                        For example, you can include tasks to set goals, let managers and
                        participants evaluate workers, and workers evaluate themselves. You
                        can create as many process flows as required to correspond to the
                        different evaluation requirements of your enterprise.
                     </p>
                     <p>The process flow dictates which sections are required
                        for the performance template. For example, if the process flow includes
                        the task for managers to rate workers, you must set up Profile Content
                        or Goals sections where managers can rate workers on competencies
                        or goals, or an Overall Summary section where managers provide an
                        overall rating.
                     </p>

                  <div class="sect2" id="FAUPM106219"><h3 class="topictitle">Performance Templates</h3>
                     <p>Performance templates bring together the information
                        that is used to create performance documents. In the performance template,
                        you:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>Select the roles that can access
                              the performance documents created from the template.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Select existing eligibility profiles
                              to restrict the performance documents to qualified workers.

                        <li>
                           <p>Specify the processing rules for
                              the document.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Enter the periods for which the
                              performance documents are valid.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Select the document type, sections,
                              and process flows to use, and any additional content on which
                              to rate workers. You can edit sections as required in the template.

                     <p>Use rating models to rate workers on
                        their performance and level of proficiency in the skills and qualities
                        that are set up on the person profile. You can also use rating models
                        to specify target proficiency levels for items on a model profile,
                        so that the model profile can be compared to workers' profiles. Use
                        the Manage Profile Rating Models task in the Profiles work area to
                        create a rating model.

                     <p>To rate workers on their performance and proficiency,
                        attach rating models to the content types included in the person profile.
                        Then you can rate workers on the items within the type. For example,
                        you can rate workers on the Communication content item within the
                        Competencies content type.

                     <p> For model profiles, you can specify target proficiency
                        levels for items on the profile, to compare model profiles with worker
                        profiles. Using the ratings:

                        individuals other than the line manager and worker to provide direct feedback into
                        the worker's performance document. Additional roles providing feedback
                        might include peers, mentors, customers, and other managers, such
                        as matrix managers. The additional roles providing feedback are called
                        participants. Participants can evaluate workers on content items by
                        providing ratings, comments, or both, and respond to a questionnaire to provide a 360-degree
                        evaluation. Participant feedback is recorded as part of the official
                        performance evaluation. By including a variety of participants who
                        have worked to some capacity with the worker, the manager can obtain
                        a broader view of the worker's performance to assist in the evaluation.

                           For example, you can create eligibility profiles to evaluate workers
                           in a specific department, job, location, or other criteria. You can
                           also combine criteria. For example, you can create a performance document

                           level 3, and located in California. You can either create one eligibility
                           profile with those three criteria, or create three separate profiles
                           with each criterion. You create eligibility profiles using the Manage
                           Talent Eligibility Profiles task in the Setup and Maintenance and
                           Performance Management work areas.

                        <p>After you select the tasks to include as part

                           are logical in sequence. For example, it's likely that you would place

                           of Worker tasks, and those before the First Approval task. However,
                           you may decide not to use all of those tasks. Your enterprise may
                           not require the Set Goals task, and let workers and managers add goals
                           and competencies to the performance document as part of the evaluation
                           tasks.

                        <p>Other tasks have more flexibility. For example, you
                           may want to schedule the Share Document task either before, or after,
                           the First Approval task, depending on when you prefer to let workers
                           see the manager ratings.

                        <p>The company has a special project for a group of workers
                           to deliver a new module within six months for their existing mobile
                           application to beat a competitor. ABC Company wants to perform a simplified
                           review of the workers who worked on this important project. The workers
                           are also subject to the annual performance evaluation in a few months.
                        </p>
                        <p>For the project review, the following applies:</p>

                                 any goals or perform a self-evaluation on the project so they can
                                 continue to concentrate on their work responsibilities.

                                 with the workers because the workers are required to acknowledge that
                                 they reviewed the manager ratings.

                        and workers can perform their respective worker evaluation tasks simultaneously
                        or at different times. In either case, the managers and workers can
                        provide ratings and comments, and add additional content to the performance
                        document until they complete and submit the document. This allows,
                        for example, managers to start working on the evaluation before the
                        workers complete it.

                     <p>You can set up approvals for performance documents to
                        include multiple approval tasks, and a hierarchy of approvers. When
                        the manager or worker submits the document for approval, approvers
                        receive notification that the document is ready for approval, and
                        they can approve or reject the document in multiple locations.

                        <p>To use approvals, you must configure the process flow to include
                           an approval task. You set up process flows using the Manage Performance
                           Process Flows task in the Setup and Maintenance work area. You can
                           set up process flows to require one, two, or no approval tasks. If
                           you include approval tasks, you can place them in whatever order your
                           business process requires. For example, you might want to create a
                           process flow with the First Approval task after the Manager Performs
                           Worker Evaluation task, and the Second Approval after the Final Feedback
                           task.

                        <p>When each approval task is reached, the manager must
                           submit the performance document for approval, even if the worker performs
                           the task before the approval task. The document goes through the entire
                           approval process so all required approvers must approve the document
                           before the evaluation continues.

                        <p>The predefined approval chain includes the
                           manager of the manager of the worker being evaluated. However, you
                           can add additional levels of approvers and other roles, such as HR
                           specialist. Other roles must have the correct privilege for approvals
                           and a data security profile that lets that includes access to the
                           worker whose performance document they're asked to approve. You set
                           up approvals and the associated notifications on the Manage Approval
                           Rules and Notifications page. To add the HR specialist as an approver,
                           you must also add an area of responsibility for the HR specialist
                           using the Manage Areas of Responsibility task in the Person Management
                           work area. Both pages are found in the Setup and Maintenance work

                           document so the approver can view it. When all approvers have approved
                           or rejected the document, the worker's manager receives notification
                           whether the document was approved or rejected. The approval process
                           is repeated if a manager resubmits a document after rejection, or

                                 flow is Completed. Not Started, by contrast, indicates the task hasn't

                        matrix managers and other participants for items in the performance
                        document.

                        <p>Fast formulas contain the items and rules used to
                           calculate the section rating, and can be based on ratings provided
                           on the items by workers, managers, and participants. You create the
                           fast formulas using the Performance Rating Calculation type. To the
                           fast formula you add Database Items (DBI). These items can calculate
                           ratings on attributes besides the overall item rating. For example,
                           you can use DBIs to rate other attributes on a goal, such as the measurement
                           attributes, rather than the overall goal. You create fast formulas
                           using the Manage Fast Formulas task in the Setup and Maintenance work
                           area.

                           the section rating. Then the application calculates the average of
                           the section ratings to determine the overall rating. The application

                           are configured to be used; otherwise, it calculates a straight average.
                           It then converts this average back to a performance document rating,
                           using the rating model.

                           rounding at the end. Rounded values can appear in the performance document for
                           the sections and overall ratings. The number of decimals displayed

                        from a possible maximum of 6.0. The 4.4 must be converted to a value
                        on the rating model for the section. The section maximum numeric rating
                        is 5, so the formula to calculate the section rating is:
                     </p> 
                     <p>(Total Decimal Score) / (Total Maximum Decimal Score)
                        x (Maximum Numeric Rating from Section Rating Model), or in this example:
                        (4.4 / 6) x 5 = 3.67.
                     </p> 
                     <p>In this example the calculated
                        section rating for competencies is 3.67 out of 5, which maps to a

                     <p>The sum of the decimal scores is 3.6,
                        from a possible maximum of 4.0. The 3.6 must be converted to a value
                        on the rating model for the section, just as for the Competencies
                        section. The section maximum numeric rating is 5, so using the same
                        formula to calculate the section rating as for competencies, the section
                        rating is: (3.6 / 4) x 5 = 4.5.

                     <p>In this example
                        the calculated section rating for goals is 4.5 out of 5, which maps
                        to a numeric rating of 5.

                     <p>To determine the overall
                        rating, the application calculates the average numeric rating for
                        the two sections. The overall rating calculation is: (4.0 + 5.0) /
                        2 = 4.5. The calculated overall rating maps to a numeric rating of
                        5.

                     <p>The following year, ABC Company uses the same rating

                        in the previous example, but applies weights to the sections and individual
                        content items. The weights determine the relative value of one section
                        compared to another section, or content items to one another. Any
                        content items that don't have weights are ignored in the calculations.

                        value on the rating model for the section. The section maximum numeric
                        rating is 5, so the formula to calculate the section rating is:

                        x (Maximum Numeric Rating from Section Rating Model), or in this example:
                        (77.0 / 100.0) x 5 = 3.85.

                        from a possible maximum of 100.0. The 88.0 must be converted to a

                        section. The section maximum numeric rating is 5, so using the same
                        formula to calculate the section rating as for competencies, the section
                        rating is: (88.0 / 100.0) x 5 = 4.40.
                     </p> 
                     <p>In this
                        example the calculated section rating for goals is 4.40 out of 5,

                     <p>To determine
                        the overall rating, the application calculates the sum of the numeric
                        ratings for the two weighted sections, then converts the score to
                        the rating model scale. ABC sets the Competencies section weight to
                        40, and the Goals section weight to 60. First, the application calculates
                        the decimal scores of the weighted sections:
                     </p> 
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Competencies: 4 / 5 = 0.8</p>

                     </ul> 
                     <p>The application then calculates the weighted
                        scores for each section, and adds them together. The total weighted
                        scores are out of a possible 100.0 points:

                     </ul> 
                     <p>The application converts the scores to the rating
                        model scale to determine the overall rating: (80.0 / 100.0) x 5 =

                        The application applies the maximum numeric rating from each rating
                        model to calculate the scores. Different weights are also applied
                        to the content items. Section weights are also applied. The performance
                        template is set up to use the standard rounding rule, and the overall
                        rating is set to display to two decimal places. The mapping method
                        is Nearest.

                     <p>The sum of the weighted scores is 84.0,
                        from a possible maximum of 100.0. The 84.0 must be converted to a
                        value on the rating model for the section. The section maximum numeric
                        rating is 7, so the formula to calculate the section rating is:
                     </p> 
                     <p>(Weighted Score) / (Total Maximum Weighted Score)
                        x (Maximum Numeric Rating from Section Rating Model), or in this example:
                        (84.0 / 100.0) x 7 = 5.88.
                     </p> 
                     <p>In this example the
                        calculated section rating for competencies is 5.88 out of 7, which
                        maps to the numeric rating 6.

                     <p>The following table
                        shows the ratings for the Goals section. The Goals section itself
                        uses a rating model with a maximum rating of 6.

                     <p>The sum of the weighted scores is 78.0,
                        from a possible maximum of 100.0. Because the maximum for the section
                        rating model is 6, the section rating is: (78.0 / 100.0) x 6 = 4.68,
                        which maps to the numeric rating of 5.

                     <p>To determine
                        the overall rating, the application calculates the sum of the numeric
                        ratings for the two weighted sections, then converts the score to
                        the rating model scale. ABC sets the Competencies section weight to
                        40, and the Goals section weight to 60. The overall summary section
                        uses a rating model with a maximum score of 9.

                     <p>First, the application calculates the decimal scores of the weighted
                        sections:

                     </ul> 
                     <p>The application then calculates the weighted
                        scores for each section, then adds them together. The section weight
                        for the Competencies section is 40, and for the Goals section it's
                        60. The total weighted scores are out of a possible 100.0 points:

                     <p>The application converts the scores to the rating
                        model scale to determine the overall rating: (83.8 / 100.0) x 9 =
                        7.542. When the rounding rules and decimal places are applied, overall
                        rating is 7.54, which maps to the section numeric rating 8.

                        is 5, so the Goals section calculated rating is: (2.8 / 4) x 5 = 3.5.

                        maps to a numeric rating of 4.

                        maps to the section numeric rating 20-.

                                 rating description, two stars may represent the Intermediate rating
                                 description, and so on. Star ratings can be used only for rating models
                                 that use 10 or fewer rating levels. If you specify not to use star
                                 ratings, managers, workers, and participants select the rating descriptions
                                 from a choice list. The rating description displays no numeric rating,
                                 but the description corresponds to a rating number set up for the
                                 rating model. The number that corresponds to the rating description
                                 selected by the worker or manager is used to calculate ratings.

                           required for this particular template. You can edit previously-defined
                           sections to suit the template requirements, including processing options,
                           properties and content.

                        <p>For each section, you must select which roles have
                           access to the section in the performance document to view and if applicable,
                           provide ratings, comments, and questionnaire feedback. For the Profile
                           Content, Goals, and Overall Summary sections, you can select whether
                           to require ratings and comments for the content items in the section.
                           If you enable section ratings for the Profile Content and Goals sections
                           and select the option to require section ratings, the process flow
                           must include an Overall Summary section. For the Questionnaire section,
                           you can select whether to require comments only. If you require comments
                           for the Questionnaire section, then you must also select the <span class="uicontrol">Participant Role Can Enter Comments Visible to Worker</span> for the section. If you give participants the option to provide

                        <p>For each section that contains content that
                           can be rated, you can add content items directly to the performance template so they
                           appear on the performance document. For both Goals and Profile Content
                           sections you can load content that was included in the previously-defined
                           section. For a Profile Content section, such as competencies, you can also copy content
                           from whatever profile the section uses as a source for content items.
                           You must set up profiles to be used as a source in this case.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This lets you target this performance template as
                           broadly or narrowly as you need. You can decide to load content items
                           from the section, for example, that apply to everyone who's rated
                           using the performance document created from this template. But you
                           may decide not to copy content directly from a profile in the template
                           because the population being evaluated has varied profiles. The workers
                           and managers can then copy profile content on the performance document
                           itself (if the process flow is set up to let them). In this case,
                           the profile content is specific to the worker.

                        <p>You can create a single, or multiple periods,
                           within a performance template. Adding multiple periods enables you
                           to create performance documents from the same template for different
                           periods. This is useful when the performance documents are treated
                           as distinct documents, but contain the same process flows, sections,
                           and processing rules. For example, you can create a template for an
                           annual evaluation to use every year. The content is updated for each
                           worker because the competencies are pulled from the selected profile
                           type, and goals are pulled from Oracle Fusion Goal Management. Managers
                           and workers can add additional content to the performance document
                           as well.

                           section. For example, if your organization requires only managers
                           to rate goals, but workers can only view the goals and ratings, you must add both
                           the manager and worker roles to that section.

                     <p>You can configure performance templates and
                        document periods to display the ratings and comments from interim
                        evaluations in subsequent performance documents. This
                        topic explains what interim ratings are and use cases for them, how
                        you configure them, and how to display them.

                        <p>You can use interim documents to view ratings and
                           comments from previous performance documents in later, or final performance
                           documents in an evaluation period. For example, you can configure
                           interim and later performance documents to capture and display ratings
                           and comments for:

                           same, more, or less information than, for example, an annual evaluation.
                           For example, you can configure the interim evaluation to require comments,
                           but not ratings, for content items and sections. Or, for simplicity,
                           the interim evaluation may not contain tasks for participant feedback
                           or approvals.

                           to associate with the document period for the final document. The
                           document types you select on the Document Periods tab determine which
                           interim ratings and comments appear in the final performance document.
                           The ratings, comments, or both (depending on configuration) from performance
                           documents associated with those document types appear in the document.

                        <p>Document types associated with the performance templates
                           used for the performance documents can be the same, or different for
                           the interim and later documents, depending on your needs. The document
                           types must be the same for all interim evaluations that you want to
                           appear cumulatively. For example, if your organization uses quarterly
                           evaluations, to see the ratings for all previous quarters in subsequent
                           quarters, each must use the same document type. If you want to isolate
                           interim performance documents from each other, but have them appear
                           in a final document, the interim performance documents must use different
                           document types. You might use this approach, for example, if you have
                           both midyear and project evaluations and need neither to be visible
                           to the other, but both to appear in an annual evaluation.

                        <p>In the document period of the performance templates
                           you use to create the performance documents you select the review
                           period. In the document period for each later document in which you
                           want interim documents to appear, you also must select the document
                           types for the interim evaluations you want to appear. If you have
                           only one document type, such as for cumulative quarterly evaluations,
                           select the document type those documents use. If you have multiple
                           evaluations to display, such as for the midyear and project evaluations
                           mentioned previously, select all document types that apply.

                     <p>You configure document periods on a performance
                        template from which to create performance documents. Performance documents
                        are created from the document period and the configured attributes,
                        such as the review period, document types, and associated questionnaires.
                        You can also associate eligibility profiles to determine which workers
                        can access the documents. This topic describes the configuration options
                        for document periods. You configure performance templates using the

                     <h3>Creating Rating Model Distributions: Points to Consider</h3>
                     <p>You can create rating model distributions
                        to set target percentages for worker overall performance ratings for
                        each rating level of a rating model.
                     </p>
                     <p>When you create a rating model distribution, consider
                        the following:
                     </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <p>Performance template to associate
                              with the rating model
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Percentages for each rating level</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Date limits for the distributions</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>You manage rating distributions using the Manage
                        Target Rating Distributions task in the Setup and Maintenance or Performance
                        Management work areas.

                        Model Distribution</h4>
                        <p>Select a performance template to associate
                           the rating model distribution with a particular performance template
                           so managers can compare the overall ratings to the same rating distribution
                           for all completed performance documents created from the template.
                           The rating model you use for the rating model distribution is the
                           one used by the Overall Summary section of the performance template.
                           You can associate the rating distribution with multiple performance
                           templates.

                        <p>The Performance and Potential box chart requires both
                           a performance rating model you select, and the predefined potential
                           rating model. For the Potential rating model, you must configure the
                           attributes of the rating model, but you cannot create and use a different
                           one for the box chart. You configure rating models using the Manage
                           Profile Rating Models task is the Setup and Maintenance work area.
                        </p>

                           Potential box chart, you must first select the performance rating
                           model to associate with the box chart. Use the Manage Performance
                           and Potential Box Chart Labels task in the Setup and Maintenance or
                           Performance Management work areas to create and update box chart labels.

                           ensures that the box chart displays the data from the performance documents created
                           from the templates. The default performance rating model is the one
                           selected in the <span class="uicontrol">Default Rating Model for

                           <li>
                              <p>Associate another box chart with
                                 that rating model

                        <p> This setup ensures that the data appears in the
                           analytic on the My Organization page.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The performance rating model you select is used along
                           the x-axis to plot performance ratings. The analytic graph uses the
                           potential rating model defined in Oracle Fusion Profile Management
                           for the y-axis to plot potential ratings. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The number of cells that appear on the analytic depends
                           on the rating categories defined for the rating models you use in
                           the analytic. The number of cells is calculated by multiplying the
                           number of rating categories defined for the potential rating model
                           by the number of rating categories for the performance rating model.
                           For example, if each rating model has three rating categories, the
                           total number of cells is: 3 x 3, or 9. If the potential rating model
                           has four rating categories and the performance rating model has three,
                           the total of cells is: 4 x 3, or 12.
