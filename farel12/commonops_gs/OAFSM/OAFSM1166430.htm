                  <p>Almost all Oracle Fusion application implementations
                     require moving functional setup data from one instance into another
                     at various points in the life cycle of the applications. For example,
                     one of the typical cases in any enterprise application implementation
                     is to first implement in a development or test application instance
                     and then deploy to a production application instance after thorough
                     testing. You can move functional setup configurations of applications
                     from one application instance into another by exporting and importing
                     setup data. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Setup data can be exported and imported for either:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>An entire offering or any of its
                           functional areas. This option is recommended when you want to make
                           sure all the setup data for an offering or functional area is migrated.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>An implementation project that
                           contains a customized configuration or list of tasks. Use an implementation
                           project as the source for exporting setup data when you require customizing
                           the list of tasks or the list of objects you want to export setup
                           data for.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>In the case of an offering or functional area, setup
                     data is exported only for the tasks relevant to the features that
                     are enabled for implementation in such offering or functional area.
                     Unlike the case of export an offering or functional area, an implementation
                     project may also include tasks for an entire offering or a functional
                     area but the list of tasks may have been customized to specific needs
                     adding or removing some of the tasks.

                  <p>It's strongly recommended you use this method
                     for data export and import to ensure migration of all relevant setup
                     data to the offering or functional area. This is especially useful
                     when doing your initial implementation or moving your implementation
                     or configuration across instances for the first time.

                  <p>This method is advantageous over others because does
                     not need you to choose the tasks nor understand data relationships
                     to ensure only setup data relevant to the selected offering or functional
                     area is exported. At the same time, gives you flexibility to filter
                     the setup data (where applicable) for such offering or functional
                     area.

                     implementation project define the setup export and import definition
                     for the configuration package.  Depending on your needs, when you
                     create a configuration package based on an implementation project,
                     you can also customize some additional aspects, as explained here.

                     <p> During export, appropriate setup data is identified
                        based on the tasks in the implementation project used as source for
                        the configuration package.  The setup data in the configuration package
                        is a snapshot of the data in the source application instance at the
                        time of export. Once export completes, you can download the configuration
                        package file as a zipped archive of multiple XML files, move it to
                        the target application instance, and upload and import it. After exporting
                        the setup data you may continue entering new or modifying existing
                        setup data for your configuration. Since the configuration package
                        is a snapshot of the setup data taken at the time export is initiated,
                        you may need to take another snapshot of the same configuration or
                        set of data later. Although you can always create a different configuration
                        package, FSM provides you the ability to take another snapshot of
                        the setup data using the same customized export and import definition
                        by exporting the configuration package multiple times and creating
                        multiple versions. While the export definition remains the same in
                        each version, the setup data can be different if you modified the
                        data in the time period between the different runs of the export process.
                        Since each version of the configuration package has a snapshot of
                        the data in the source instance, you can compare and analyze various
                        versions of the configuration package to see how the setup data changed.

                        created by the export process and then import the setup data. All
                        setup data contained in the configuration package is imported into
                        the environment you initiate the setup data import from. In the target
                        application instance, the setup import process inserts all new data
                        from the source configuration package that does not already exist,
                        and update any existing data with changes from the source. Setup data
                        that exists in the target instance but not in source will remain unchanged.

                  <p>A Configuration Package contains the setup

                     identifies the setup data for export as well as the data itself. When
                     you create a configuration package only the setup export and import
                     definition exists. Once you submit export, a snapshot of the appropriate
                     setup data is added to the configuration package using the definition.
                     You can continue making modifications to the setup data in the environment
                     and create a new configuration package any time you need it.

                     the tasks within the configuration selected to export setup data for.
                     This is because the task sequence should be congruent to the sequence

                     data can be filtered by specific export scope values if the business
                     object has scope enabled for setup data export.  These business objects
                     are known as scope enabled business objects and are typically qualifiers
                     of other setup data. Some of the examples of business objects with
                     scope are Business Units, Legal Entities, Ledgers, and Territories.
                     Scope enabled business objects might potentially be used to filter
                     or segment other setup data during setup export. Example: You can
                     get filter and export all transaction tax data for a given tax regime.
                     During export, you have the option to select specific scope values
                     for such business objects and they are used as filter criteria for
                     exporting setup data of the relevant business objects that depend
                     on them. For any setup data where scope is applicable, only the data
                     that matches the selected values are exported.

                        an implementation project, you may see some business objects listed
                        and used as scope parameters. These correspond to business objects
                        used as parameters just for the purpose of filtering setup data for
                        some tasks within the implementation project used as source for the
                        configuration package.

                        <p>The data for business objects used as scope parameters
                           is not exported because these business objects are not directly associated
                           to any tasks in the implementation project used to create the configuration
                           package. During export, all scope values defined by user are passed
                           to each service to filter the appropriate data. Each service uses
                           the applicable parameters and return the appropriate setup data. Therefore
                           data of the business objects that depend on the business object scope
                           parameter is filtered and exported.

                        Even if subledger is not associated with any tasks in the Receivables
                        configuration you selected to export, you have the option to filter
                        receivables data associated to certain subledgers during export. You
                        find the subledger business object listed as scope parameter even

                           continues with the next business object in the list. If no service
                           is available, then the business object is marked as requiring manual

                           shares it. Because the service takes care of all the relevant setup
                           data at once, it only must be invoked once during the process; therefore,
                           Functional Setup Manager marks as processed and with the same result,

                           may be marked as recommended to perform prior to import when other
                           setup data depend on it. Import setup data process warns and reminds
                           you of performing such task before proceeding with your import process.
                           Make sure to perform such tasks prior to import to avoid data dependency
                           issues while running import.

                           data are marked as recommended to perform during import. The import
                           setup data process pauses when it reaches such business object and
                           waits until user confirms such setup data was imported by user. Functional
                           Setup Manager pauses the import setup data process at the proper time
                           to remind you and wait for confirmation that such setup data is entered

                           tasks just to ensure all your configuration setup data is migrated
                           but you do not have to perform prior or during the import necessarily.

                  <p>Depending on the method used to import the setup
                     data, you first have to upload the configuration package file created
                     by the export process prior to initiate the import process. During
                     the import, this file is read to identify all the business objects
                     which setup data is included in it. Once the import process is initiated,
                     it warns users to perform the task recommended performing prior to
                     import. Once user decides to continue, Functional Setup Manager starts
                     invoking the business object services based on the import sequence
                     assigned to the business objects in such configuration. When required,
                     the import process pauses giving you the appropriate information and
                     suggested actions. Resume the import process after taking the appropriate
                     actions.

                           due to errors encountered, then review the errors and take appropriate
                           actions to correct the data or fix the issue, and then resume the
                           process. The process resumes processing data for the failed object.
                           However, you have the option to skip the failed object and continue
                           processing data for the next business object in the list.

                     stopped or canceled the process. Services perform an update and insert
                     operation. That is, existing rows that are identical to the data being
                     imported are ignored, existing rows that have differences are updated,
                     and new rows are inserted. Each service is invoked once and imports

                  <p>Although it's recommended that you export
                     and import setup data for an offering, you may require an incremental
                     data migration during your implementation. In such cases, you can
                     export and import setup data for more granular configurations than
                     an offering such as a functional area or a task list. There are several
                     considerations to keep in mind if you migrate more granular configurations.

                              with the appropriate tasks for the configuration you want to migrate.

                           <p>Make sure that all prerequisite
                              data for your configuration is available in the environment where
                              you are planning to migrate the setup data. For example, If you require
                              a legal entity to exist before you migrate the setup data for a business
                              unit configuration and the prerequisite setup data does not exist,
                              consider to adding it to the configuration package you use to import.

                              the business objects in your configuration should align with the business
                              object dependencies and prerequisites. Oracle delivered task lists
                              have been designed with this in mind to avoid errors while running

                              package by defining the scope selection. Be aware that scope selection
                              is not available to all business objects. Check that the business
                              object service supports it. Check the application documentation or
                              verify it from the application at the time you are defining your configuration
                              package. A select and add icon is enabled on the scope table once
                              you select the corresponding business object.

                     <p>You can use Setup data comparison to learn how data
                        for a given implementation has changed over time. For instance, an
                        implementation may have been done in phases and some of the original
                        configuration has been modified. You can track the changes over time
                        through different versions of the same configuration package, or different
                        configuration packages. Once you identify the setup data differences
                        or discrepancies you make a decision on how to resolve them. You can
                        import the setup data from the configuration package into the environment
                        if the wanted implementation matches what is in the configuration
                        package. You can also resolve the discrepancies for a given record
                        or business object by editing the setup data through the relevant
                        task. The setup data comparison functionality helps you speed up the
                        process of identifying the differences among one or multiple business
                        objects relevant to a configuration. The comparison identifies which
                        records are common to either configuration packages' alternate key
                        matching. The report shows any data differences in the records with
                        matching alternate keys. If alternate keys are not defined for the
                        business object, then the entire data record is compared in the report.
                     </p>

                        is not controlled by the application.

                     <p>You can identify the setup data differences between
                        configuration packages using the compare function available from the

                        Implementation Consultant security role to compare setup data. You
                        can compare setup data between two different configuration packages
                        or two versions of the same configuration package. To compare a configuration
                        package to data in a current environment, export the setup data for
                        the current environment into a new configuration package for comparison.

                  <p>Functional Setup Manager enables users to
                     implement and configure all Oracle Fusion Applications as well as
                     to move the setup data across instances. This is generally done using
                     Functional Setup Manager export and import functionality built into
                     the application. It is strongly recommended that you use and access
                     this functionality from the Manage Configuration Packages page. As
                     an alternate method, an Application Implementation Consultant user
                     can move the setup data using the export and import functionality
                     accessed from a command line. Be aware that some capabilities and
                     restrictions may appear when using command-line functionality.

                     <p>Before you move the Functional Setup Data to the
                        target environment, you must identify the implementation projects
                        used to enter and define the setup data in the source environment.
                        Ask your Application Implementation Consultant user to gather the
                        codes of the implementation projects. You can gather the implementation
                        codes using Oracle Fusion Functional Setup Manager or SQL. To obtain
                        a list of the implementation codes using SQL, use the following query: <code>SQL&gt; SELECT impl_project_name, short_name from asm_impl_projects_vl; </code></p>

                     <p>A setup business object is a self-contained
                        representation of a business entity supported by a setup task. These
                        are logical representations of real-world objects. Setup business
                        objects represent the data entered when you perform setup tasks. Business
                        objects used by setup tasks also require web services to facilitate
                        export and import of corresponding data. Setup data entered by way
                        of a setup task is stored in the table associated with the corresponding
                        business object. For example, Primary Ledger is the business object
                        of the setup task called Manage Primary Ledger. When the Manage Primary
                        Ledger task is performed, data entered is stored in the tables associated
                        with the Primary Ledger business object.

                        performing an assigned implementation task, then the selected values
                        are preselected as candidates for filtering setup during export and
                        import. Some application core tasks, such as tasks for defining profile
                        options, have parameters defined that you can use as setup filters
                        and are preselected as filter candidates for export and import. You
                        can remove any of these preselected values when you are creating the
                        configuration package. You can also add more scope values for export
                        and import purposes only.
