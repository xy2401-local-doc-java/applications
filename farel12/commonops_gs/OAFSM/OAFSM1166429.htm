                     <p>Offerings are application solution sets representing
                        one or more business processes and activities that you typically provision
                        and implement as a unit. They are, therefore, the primary drivers
                        of functional setup of Oracle Fusion applications. Some of the examples

                     <p>A functional area is a grouping of functionality
                        within an offering. It may be an optional piece of functionality that
                        you may want to implement as part of an offering. Optional functional
                        areas can be included or excluded from their parent offering. Functional
                        areas may be hierarchical, and therefore may be subordinate to another
                        functional area. An offering has at least one base or core functional
                        area and may have one or more optional functional areas. Additionally,
                        one or more or features may be associated to an offering. Base functional areas indicate the core functionality that you need to implement for the
                        offering to be operational.Optional functional areas indicate optional functionality that you may or may not implement
                        for an offering.

                        <p>Some core functionality essential to an offering
                           such as setting the Initial Users or the Legal Structures may be shared
                           across offerings. These are known as common functional areas and appear
                           across offerings. Although most of the tasks associated to a common
                           functional area are the same regardless of the offering you implement,
                           there may be some offering-specific tasks.

                        <p>In general once you implement a common functional
                           area for a given offering, you won't need to repeat its implementation
                           for the remaining offerings, however, it's recommended you check if
                           there is any offering specific tasks that may still require your attention.

                           for an offering are known as base functional areas and must be implemented in order for the offering to be operational.
                           Other functional areas known as optional functional areas support processes or functionality that can be implemented at your
                           discretion depending on the business requirements. These can be implemented

                     and instead use a modular approach to your implementation.  You can
                     complete setup of specific business areas quickly to start transactions,
                     and then gradually adopt more and more application functionality as

                  <p>An offering or functional area-based approach means
                     you set up various parts of an offering at different times. You can
                     start with set up of the functional areas that you immediately need
                     to adopt.  Over time, you can continue to set up other functional
                     areas as you start to adopt additional applications functionality.
                     Offerings must be enabled for implementation in order for their functional
                     areas to display. Offering or functional area-based implementation
                     provides the following advantages:

                           areas are those shared across offerings and are listed first. The
                           functional areas that are only associated with the selected offering,
                           are at the bottom of the list.

                        <p>A functional area usually has several
                           setup tasks, but only a few of them require input before the application
                           function is ready for transactions.  The rest of the setup tasks are
                           usually optional or have predefined default values based on common
                           use cases. When you select a functional area for implementation, you

                        to render the page where you perform the task.  If the setup data
                        entered through a task can be segmented by a specific attribute, and
                        therefore could be performed iteratively for each qualifying value,
                        then the task may benefit from scope. Typical examples include tasks
                        relevant to legal entities, business units, ledgers, tax regimes,
                        and legislative data roles.  For such tasks, you are prompted to pick
                        a scope value before entering data. You can pick a scope value that
                        was previously selected, select a new scope value, or create a new
                        scope value and then select it. The selected value is a qualifying
                        attribute of the setup data entered by way of the task, and therefore,
                        different setup data can be entered for different scope values. Enter
                        data as appropriate and once you finish, close the page and you return
                        to the functional area list of tasks.

                        <p>When creating an implementation project you see the
                           list of offerings and functional areas that are configured for implementation.
                           Implementation managers specify which of those offerings and functional
                           areas to include in an implementation project.  It is strongly recommended
                           that you limit your selection to one offering per implementation project,
                           even though the application does not prevent you from including more
                           than one. The implementation manager should decide based on how they
                           plan to manage their implementations. For example, if you implement
                           and deploy different offerings at different times, then having separate
                           implementation projects help to manage the implementation life cycles.
                           Furthermore, the more offerings you included in an implementation
                           project, the bigger the generated task list is. This is because the
                           implementation task list includes all setup tasks needed to implement
                           all included offerings. Alternatively, segmenting into multiple implementation

                     <p>Once you make offering and functional area
                        selections, Oracle Fusion Functional Setup Manager creates the implementation
                        project and generates a complete list of setup tasks based upon your
                        selections. The predefined hierarchical task list added when you select
                        an offering is called the offering top task list. It includes a complete
                        list of all tasks, including the prerequisites required to implement
                        the offering. Typically, this task list has the same name as the name
                        of the offering it represents. If multiple offerings are included
                        in a single implementation project, then each one of the offering
                        top task lists shows as a top node in the implementation task list
                        hierarchy.

                           excluded from the task list. The implementation task list is generated
                           according to the offering configurations and top task list definitions
                           present at the time an implementation project is created. Once created,
                           the task list in the implementation project becomes self-contained
                           and does not change based on any changes made to the offering configurations
                           or top task list definitions.

                           the offerings in different orders. A predecessor task may also be
                           a common task for many different offerings. If a predecessor task
                           was performed as part of a previous implementation and setup data

                           without performing the predecessor tasks in the current implementation.
                           The predecessor and the dependent tasks might be performed in parallel
                           by entering certain values of predecessor first and then followed

                  <p>All implementations require modifications
                     to the setup data over time. A full implementation cycle using an
                     implementation project is recommended for larger and higher risk modifications,
                     such as reorganizing territories, or adding a new tax regime. You
                     can make smaller changes such as changing profile options, or a list
                     of values by searching for the appropriate task from the Overview
                     page and performing the task directly from there.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>When setup data of an existing implementation requires
                     modification that involves a significant number of tasks and task
                     lists or has high risk implication in many parts of an application,
                     maintaining those setup changes through implementation projects is
                     advisable.  Often you should perform the modifications in a test environment
                     to mitigate risks before applying the changes to a production environment.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>For maintenance of setup data, you can create an implementation
                     project without selecting offerings or functional areas. You can add
                     tasks and task lists specific to the needed modification directly
                     to the implementation project. Once the implementation project is
                     created, functionality is exactly the same as any implementation project
                     you create based on offerings and functional areas. The processes
                     for assigning users to tasks to maintain the setup data and finally
                     to export and import the changes to the target instance is the same
                     as implementation projects you create based on offerings and functional
                     areas.

                  <p>You can use Oracle Fusion Functional Setup
                     Manager to implement a new configuration by copying an existing one
                     that is similar and only requires few modifications. For example,
                     you can create a new Business Unit by copying an existing one and
                     then changing some of the Flexfield segment values to support the
                     new configuration. During the copy configuration process, a new configuration
                     is always created. Copy configuration doesn't allow you to modify
                     an existing configuration. If you require modification of an existing
                     configuration, navigate to the tasks and edit the appropriate data.

                     the copy configuration process.

                     <h3 class="topictitle">How Copy Configuration Works</h3>
                     
                     <p>During the process of copying an existing configuration,
                        you first select the existing configuration you want to copy setup
                        data from to create the new configuration. The setup data is then
                        copied to a staging area where you can edit it and make the appropriate
                        modifications to create the new configuration. As the purpose of the
                        copy functionality is to provide an easier way to speed up the implementation
                        of new configurations, only the most commonly required and applicable
                        attributes of the configuration are exposed. The copy configuration

                        reviewing the generated task list and comparing it with your implementation
                        needs. When adding tasks you can decide where in the hierarchy the
                        tasks fit and you can sequence the implementation task list accordingly.
                        When adding, reordering or removing tasks you must consider data dependencies
                        and their implications on export.

                        common tasks. Common tasks are repeated in an implementation project
                        in case implementation of multiple offerings requires different data
                        for the same task. Each duplicate task points to the same interface
                        and data irrespective of which offering implementation it is used
                        for, so setup data is not duplicated unless you want to do so. You
                        can review the existing data and decide whether or not to enter additional
                        data because of the new offering.

                        a web service for export or import of the data. If you create a custom

                     <p>An implementation project consists of all the
                        tasks required for the implementation. You refine the list of tasks
                        for the implementation project by reviewing and selecting functional
                        areas and features. Because only tasks required for the selected functionality
                        are included, project initiation productivity is improved.

                     <p>Selecting offerings, functional areas, and the related
                        features associated with each offering creates an implementation task
                        list based only on the functionality you implement. This can greatly
                        enhance productivity by presenting a targeted list of tasks in the
                        appropriate implementation order.
