                  <p>An organization goal specifies the overall
                     objectives of the organization. Organization owners are managers
                     who manage organization
                     goals e. You must have an organization goal plan to manage
                     organization goals. HR specialists assign organization goal plans to organization owners.
                     Then organization owners publish or assign their organization goals
                     to their organization. You must have either the line manager or the
                     executive manager role to manage organization goals. As a manager,
                     you can manage only those organization goals that you created or added
                     to the goal plan. You manage organization goals from the My Organization
                     Goals page in the Goals work area.

                        if enabled, to a goal. However, you can't add target outcomes to an

                        you can also align any goals of your direct reports to a published
                        organization goal. Both the worker goal and organization goal must
                        be associated with the same review period. The goal plan associated
                        with worker goals can be different than that of the aligned organization
                        goal. You can also align organization goals to another organization
                        goal within the same review period. You can click the goal alignment
                        icon to view the alignment hierarchy for the goal.
