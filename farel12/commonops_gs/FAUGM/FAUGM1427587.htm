                        person profile, the profile is updated to include new or changed information.
                        You can enable target outcomes by using goal management profile options.

                     <p>Managers and workers can add target outcomes to goals
                        when adding or editing performance goals for workers. They can select
                        target outcomes from the available list of content types, such as
                        competencies.

                     <p>Target outcomes are content types that contain content items and
                        maintained in Profile Management. Goal Management uses predefined
                        content types Licenses and Certifications, Competencies, and Languages
                        as target outcomes. HR specialists can remove any of these target
                        outcomes from goals by removing the relationship between the Goals
                        content type and the corresponding content type in Profile Management.

                     <p>When the performance goal is completed, and approved
                        if approvals are required, then the worker's person profile is updated
                        to include the target outcomes. For content items that require a rating
                        level, such as competencies, the manager must select a rating level,
                        which is the rating level associated with the content item. If approvals
                        aren't enabled for completing the percentage completion of a goal,
                        the worker can also rate the competency associated with the goal.
                        The evaluation type displayed for the competency is Self when the
                        worker rates the competency.

                        a competency aren't deleted from the worker's profile. Depending upon
                        the evaluation type, the user who rated the worker's competency can
                        delete or update the rating on the worker's person profile even after
                        the goal is deleted.

                     the goal library and worker's goals. Workers and managers can maintain goals either

                     <p>Performance goals that workers or managers add or
                        edit in Goal Management or performance documents are maintained such
                        that they are consistent in both applications. For example, primary
                        goal characteristics, such as the goal name, description, success
                        criteria, and completion date, are kept identical in both locations.
                        Any attachments to goals are also displayed in the performance document.
                        The performance goal details held in performance documents and the
                        Goal Management component have some differences:

                              manager provide in the performance document aren't available on the
                              Goal Management pages.
                           </p>

                              Management pages are added to the performance document only when the
                              goal is initially added to the document; afterward, weights are maintained
                              independently.

                              management pages; however comments from the Goal Management pages
                              appear in the performance document.

                     <p>Workers and managers can add performance goals on
                        the Goal Management pages and the goals are pulled into the workers'
                        performance documents when the documents are created. Goal plans are
                        required to manage goals in Goal Management. The goals in a goal plan
                        associated with the review period and document type selected for the
                        performance document appear in the document when it's created.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When managers or workers edit the worker's existing
                        goals in Goal Management, the changes are reflected in the performance
                        document when it's opened. To copy new goals into the performance
                        document from the goal management business process they must use the
                        Update Goals and Competencies action in the performance document.
                        The Update Goals and Competencies action creates a new goal, but copies
                        its key attributes from an existing goal in another performance document.
                        The action is found on the pages used to evaluate the worker or set
                        document content. Goals are not automatically removed from the performance
                        document and must be manually removed.
