                     <p>Use performance goals that are specific,
                        measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-based (SMART) to measure
                        the performance of workers, help them improve productivity, and achieve
                        career objectives. Performance goals are results-oriented, measure
                        work-related performance, and often use specific targets to assess
                        the level of workers' achievement. For example, the performance goals
                        can specify how workers measure achievement of objectives and include
                        target dates.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Use performance goals in performance documents as
                        part of the evaluation process. Workers and managers can create performance
                        goals. HR specialists
                        can create organization goals. Organization goals are performance
                        goals that you create, or those from the goal library, to set the
                        business direction and targets for your organization. Managers who
                        are also organization owners can add existing performance goals as
                        organization goals. They can then assign them to any level of the
                        manager assignment hierarchy to support the organization's overall
                        business objectives. Workers' can align their own goals to the organization
                        goals to achieve the same objective.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Depending on your application settings, you can add
                        tasks and target out comes to a your goal. Tasks are specific actions
                        you add to a goal that a worker undertakes to achieve the goal. Goal
                        tasks have various types, including mentoring, researching, and coaching.
                        Target outcomes enable the linking of a goal to specific skills or
                        qualifications such as competencies, languages, and licenses and certifications.
                        Use target outcomes to increase a worker's proficiency for current
                        or future job requirements, or to add to the worker's set of skills.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Workers can mark the performance goals that they
                        create as private. Private performance goals aren't visible to others
                        including managers

                     <p>Goal plans are used to manage a collection
                        of performance goals for a specific period. HR specialists can roll
                        out goal plans to individuals, a selected hierarchy, or a wider population
                        within the organization. Depending on your role permissions, you can
                        add goals for a worker only when the worker is assigned goal plans.
                        To add goals to a worker, you must ensure that goal plans are already
                        assigned to the worker. You can associate a worker goal only with
                        one goal plan at a time. Each goal plan is associated with a review
                        period.

                     <p>Goal plan sets are used to group and assign
                        performance goal plans to a population set. Each goal plan set is
                        associated with a review period.

                     <p>Review periods enable you to organize your
                        processes around goal management and performance evaluations into
                        time-bound business cycles. Review period is a common component that
                        ties to goal plans and performance document periods. For example,
                        you create review periods to associate with goal plans and performance
                        documents that fall within the same time frame.

                        and indirect reports as an alternative to assigning goals. For example,

                        the worker to decide whether or not to add the goals. Workers can

                     <p>Performance goals may have been assigned by
                        the organization
                        owner or HR specialist
                        before you assigned any goals. Goals might also be present because
                        the workers created the goals themselves, or copied the goals from
                        shared or organization goals. The HR specialist can assign goals when creating or editing
                        a goal plan.

                        can edit some attributes of the goal to make it fit your situation.
                        You can select the start and end dates for the goal.
