                     <p>You can restrict performance goals to individuals
                        who meet eligibility requirements by job, job role, location, age, or other criteria. You must select eligibility profiles
                        with profile usage marked as Goals Management. You can also select
                        whether an eligibility profile is required for goals. For example,
                        you can add the following eligibility profiles to a goal:
                     </p>

                        </li>

                     <p>When mass assigning goals or creating and assigning
                        a goal plan or goal plan set, you select Location is France as the
                        required eligibility profile and leave the other two eligibility profiles
                        as not required. In this case, the application assigns goals to all
                        individuals whose location is France and designation is Marketing
                        Manager or Product Manager.

                     <p>Use eligibility profiles when you mass assign performance
                        goals or create and assign goal plans and goal plan sets to a target
                        population. However, using eligibility profiles in these Goal Management

                        goals from other sources. You might assign a performance goal to a
                        worker from the goal library or from other Oracle Fusion business
                        processes, such as during a talent review meeting, or during a performance
