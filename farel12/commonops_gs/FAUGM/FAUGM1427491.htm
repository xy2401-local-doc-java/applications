                  <p>Workers can add measurements to assess the

                        data for the measurement, such as target type, target value, and actual

                     <p>You align performance goals to create
                        a relationship between a worker's goal and a higher-level goal, such
                        as an organization or manager goal. This relationship enables the worker's goal to
                        support and contribute to achieve the higher-level goal. You can align
                        one of your goals to only one other goal; both goals must be associated
                        with the same review period.

                        to support peers' goals if they are within the same review period.
                        This allows workers on informal teams or groups working across different
                        reporting groups to show a relationship between each other. For the
                        owner of the goal to which others are aligned, it's a way to determine
                        how many people are working towards the goal, for example, for a specific
                        project or initiative. You can't align private goals to another goal
                        or have other goals aligned to them.
