                     <p>HR specialists can always add goals to a goal plan.
                        If managers and workers are allowed to add goals to the goal plan,
                        they can add goals to an existing goal plan. The goals they plan to
                        add must have start, target, or actual completion dates within or
                        equal to the start and end dates of the goal plan. If they want a
                        worker to continue working on the goal for a period later than the
                        current goal plan, they can extend the goal to another goal plan.
                        After extending, the goal is associated with both the source and target
                        goal plans. Any subsequent changes to the goal in the source goal
                        plan are also carried onto the target goal plan.

                     <p>When creating a goal plan, HR specialists can enable
                        to enter weight for goals in the goal plan. They can further select
                        the option to ensure that the sum of all goal weights in the goal
                        plan is 100%. They can allocate weight to each goal included in the
                        goal plan. Managers and workers can modify weight for each goal for
                        a goal plan later. A goal weight indicates the relative importance
                        of each goal in the goal plan. Other Oracle Fusion Applications products
                        can consume these weights in their processes. For example, the incentive
                        compensation plan can use these weights and the worker's actual achievement
                        of the goal objectives, to calculate the worker's incentive pay.

                     <p>Use the Manage Goal Plans link in the Related
                        Links panel on the Tasks tab  in the Goals work area to assign a goal
                        plan to an organization or manager hierarchies and individuals after
                        you create or submit the plan. Goals that are already part of the
                        plan are assigned to the new people to whom the goal plan is assigned.
                        You can assign a goal plan to an organization or to workers, but not
                        both. You assign goal plans to a manager hierarchy or individuals.
                        You can also assign goal plans to an organization to make the plans
                        visible to line managers or executive managers on the My Organization
                        Goals page. On that page, managers can view and assign goals to the
                        plan.

                     <p>Workers, managers, and organizations can have more
                        than one goal plan assigned to them. For example, you can create a
                        goal plan for a manager's direct and indirect reports so that workers
                        have one plan that is active now and another plan with a future start
                        date. You can use the future goal plan to hold goals that will be
                        addressed later, or current goals that span a longer period than the
                        current goal plan. They can also have concurrent plans. For example,
                        one for organization goals and another for other performance goals.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When assigning the goal plan to an organization,
                        HR specialists can search for an organization owner or a department
                        within an organization. For the department, the search results display
                        the list of all line managers within the department. The HR specialist
                        can then select a line manager within that department as the organization
                        owner and assign the goal plan. The goal plan is also assigned to
                        all line managers who are under the same department as the selected
                        line manager. If the notification is enabled, only the actual organization
                        owner of the department receives a notification about the goal plan
                        assigned to the organization. The actual organization owner of a department
                        is specified in the Workforce Structures work area. You edit the owner
                        of an organization using the Manage Departments task in the Workforce
                        Structures work area.

                     <p>You can add eligibility profiles to goal plans to
                        assign goals included in the plan to individuals who meet the criteria
                        of all required profiles. You can restrict goals to workers who meet
                        eligibility requirements by job, job role, location, age, or other
                        criteria. For example, you can add a location eligibility profile
                        to a goal plan if you want to restrict goals to individuals who are
                        located in a certain place. You can further refine eligibility by
                        adding length of service criteria to restrict workers by location
                        and length of service.

                        population, you can assign these to the plan directly. If goals are
                        generally added by managers and workers, you can assign one goal plan
                        to a wide population without goals.

                        an organization. To create a goal plan, you must first create a review
                        period you associate with the goal plan. If you create a goal plan
                        for a review period and assign the goal plan both to individuals and
                        an organization, any performance goals that you add to the goal plan
                        will be assigned to the individuals, but not to the organization.

                     <p>You can either add individuals to an existing goal plan, or create a
                        new goal plan and assign it to individuals who are new to the organization.
                        If you add new performance goals to an existing goal plan, the new
                        goals are assigned to everyone to whom the goal plan is assigned.
                        However, any goals included earlier in an existing goal plan but already
                        assigned to any selected workers remain assigned. There are no changes
                        to such goals for the selected workers. Similarly, if you remove any
                        workers included earlier in the goal plan and resubmit the process
                        to assign the goal plan, the goal and the goal plan remain assigned

                     <p>When you move a goal to another goal plan,
                        the goal is no longer associated with the source goal plan. For example,
                        you move a goal to another goal plan when you want to associate the
                        goal with a different performance document.

                     <p>When you extend a goal to another goal plan,
                        the goal is associated with both source and target goal plans. Except
                        for the goal weight, any changes to the goal are visible in both the
                        source and target goal plans after you extend the goal. For example,
                        if you couldn't complete a goal before the source goal plan end date,
                        you extend the goal to another goal plan to continue working on the
                        goal for an extended duration.
