                     <p>Add eligibility profiles to a mass assignment
                        request to restrict performance goals included in the request to individuals
                        who meet the criteria of all required profiles. You can restrict goals
                        to workers who meet eligibility requirements by job, job role, location,
                        age, or other criteria. For example, add a location eligibility profile
                        to a request to restrict goals to individuals who are located in a
                        certain place. You can further refine eligibility by adding length
                        of service criteria to restrict workers by location and length of
                        service.

                     <p>After you submit a request on the Mass Assign
                        Goal page, the Manage Goal Scheduled Process page automatically appears.
                        You can run the process straight away or at a scheduled time (once
                        or at recurring intervals.) After the process is complete, the goals
                        included in the request are assigned to all workers that were selected
                        in the request. To view the result, click the <span class="uicontrol">Assignment Results</span> button on the Mass Assign Goals page.

                     <p>You can also use the Goals work area to open the
                        Manage Goal Scheduled Process task in the Related Links panel on the
                        Tasks tab.

                     <p>If you rerun the process for an existing request,
                        edit a mass assignment request and then rerun the process, or submit
                        a new request:
