                     <p>You assign goal plan sets to a selected hierarchy
                        or individuals when creating the goal plan set or at a later time.
                        You can also exclude specific assignees reporting to a manager. When
                        assigning more than one goal plan set to an individual, ensure that
                        the dates on which sets are active don't overlap with each other.
                        For example, create a current goal plan set for a manager's direct
                        and indirect reports so that workers have one goal plan set that is
                        active now, and another with a future start date. You can use the
                        future goal plan set to hold goal plans that will be addressed later,
                        or current goal plans that span a longer period than the current goal
                        plan set. After you submit a goal plan set for assignment, you can
                        add or remove individuals, and then resubmit the set for assignment.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Add eligibility profiles to a goal plan set to ensure
                        goal plans added to the goal plan set are assigned to individuals
                        who meet the criteria of all required profiles. For example, you can
                        add a location eligibility profile to a goal plan set to assign goal
                        plans to individuals who are located in certain place. You can further
                        refine eligibility by adding length of service criteria to restrict
                        workers by location and length of service.

                        if enabled. A goal plan weight indicates the relative importance of
                        each goal plan. Other Oracle Fusion Applications products can consume
                        these weights in their processes. For example, the incentive compensation
                        plan can use these weights and the worker's actual achievement of
                        the goal objectives, to calculate the worker's incentive pay.

                        set FY2015 Annual-UK. The end date of the before transfer goal plan
                        set, FY2015 Annual-US, and the start date of the post transfer goal
                        plan set, FY2015 Annual-UK, conflict with each other. The application
                        sets the status of the goal plan set FY2015 Annual-UK to pending and
                        sends the notification about the date conflict to Barbara Richardson,
                        the HR specialist. Barbara uses the <span class="uicontrol">Change
                           Dates</span> option from the <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span> menu on the Administer Goals page with <span class="uicontrol">Worker Goal Plan Sets</span> selected as <span class="uicontrol">Source</span>. She views proposed changes as suggested by the
                        application. She accepts the proposed changes and assigns both the
                        goal plan sets with the updated effective dates.

                  <p>When the conflict occurs, the dates of the existing
                     goal plan sets remain same as they were defined. However, the goal
                     plan set that is assigned to a worker post transfer is set to the
                     pending status. The goals and goal plans included in the pending goal
                     plan set are not assigned to the worker until the goal plan set status
                     is set to active.
