                     on your mobile device.  The workers' whose information you can update
                     depends on your data security. For example, a Human Resources Specialist
                     can update the contact information of a worker while an employee can't
                     update the same information for a co-worker. Some information is date-effective. So, if there are any future-dated changes, you will not be able
                     to edit that specific information. When approvals are required, if
                     a previous change is pending approval, you will not be able to edit
                     your personal information until the previous change is approved.
