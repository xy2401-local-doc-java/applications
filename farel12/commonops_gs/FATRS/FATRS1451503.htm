                        two prior meetings, then the maximum number of records must be at

                        to display on the box chart. The color scheme provides a visual cue
                        of the progress of worker ratings. For the <span class="uicontrol">Blue and white</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Red and green</span> color schemes, one color starts at the bottom left and becomes fainter
