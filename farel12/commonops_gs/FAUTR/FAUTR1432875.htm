                  <p>On the Prepare Review Content page, talent review reviewers update the ratings of workers they manage who are part of the review
                     population before the talent review meeting. When they submit the page, the new
                     ratings are reflected on the worker profile. The talent review meeting

                     <p>Reviewers receive notification to update ratings
                        with a link to the Prepare Review Content page when the meeting facilitator
                        creates and submits the meeting. They can also select <span><span class="uicontrol">My Team</span> - <span class="uicontrol"> Talent Review</span></span> to open the participants'
                        Overview page, where you open the Prepare Review Content page. Reviewers
                        can update content until the meeting data submission deadline. Once
                        the meeting starts reviewers can't edit any ratings. They can, however,
                        add and view notes and tasks, and access their view of the box chart
                        matrix to see where their reports appear on it before the meeting
                        starts.

                     <p>Meeting facilitators can set a data validity guideline to ensure that ratings are updated within the time frame specified
                        by the guideline. On the Prepare Review Content page, an icon appears
                        next to ratings that fall outside the guideline to warn you to update
                        the ratings. When you change a rating, the icon disappears. However,
                        it doesn't disappear if the rating doesn't change, even if you remove
                        and restore the current rating. All ratings, updated or not, are recorded
                        as updated when you submit the ratings.
                     </p>

                     <p>You can use the Potential Assessment questionnaire
                        to calculate potential for a worker, if it's enabled. When you click
                        the Complete Assessment button, the Potential Assessment questionnaire
                        appears. You must answer all the questions to calculate the rating.
                        You can also select the potential rating manually without using the
                        Potential Assessment questionnaire.

                        open a preview of the Talent Review dashboard to see where your direct
                        and indirect reports appear in the box chart matrix. You can move
                        them on the box chart and their updated ratings are reflected on the
                        Prepare Review Content page. On the dashboard, you can view succession
                        plans and talent pools for which you're an owner if they're added
                        by facilitators when they create the meeting. You can create additional
                        succession plans or talent pools as well. You can also perform many
                        other actions that are available on the dashboard during the meeting.
                        For example, you can create tasks and notes, and add goals for your
                        reports.

                        organization for the talent review. The notes can be viewed on the
                        Manage Notes and Tasks page as well.

                        below you in your organizational hierarchy to submit data about their
                        own direct reports. When you grant access to another person, that
                        person receives notification to update the content with a link to
                        the Prepare Review Content page. To open the Grant Access page, select <span><span class="uicontrol">My Team</span> - <span class="uicontrol"> Talent Review</span></span>, and click <span class="uicontrol">Grant Access</span> for the meeting for which you
                        are scheduled to prepare content.

                     <p>You can either save or submit the Prepare Review
                        Content page. If you submit the page, the worker profile updates with
                        the edited ratings. If you save the page, the edited ratings are saved
                        and appear in the talent review meeting, but the worker profile does
                        not update. You can also return to the page and continue editing data
                        until the meeting starts.

                     <p>The talent review meeting uses data
                        from the worker's current profile record. If the reviewer doesn't
                        submit ratings prior to the meeting, the most recent ratings are used
                        even if the ratings are outside of the data validity guidelines. If
                        the profile record contains no performance or potential ratings, the
                        worker appears in the holding area of the Talent Review meeting dashboard at the
                        start of the meeting. The worker doesn't appear in the box chart matrix.
                        Meeting participants can rate the worker during the meeting.

                     <h3>Can reviewers see data for workers they don't manage when preparing content?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>No. Outside the talent review meeting, when reviewers update ratings on the Prepare Review Content page or the dashboard
                        view available from that page, they can see profile data for their
                        direct and indirect reports only. However, during the meeting, such
                        as in a conference room when the facilitator dashboard is projected
                        on a screen, reviewers who are also participants can see
                        profile data for all persons being reviewed.
