                  <p>Using succession management, you can create

                              workers whose person profiles most closely match the job or position
                              requirements.

                     <p>Succession plans can have multiple owners from different
                        organizations, so the plan can include candidates from multiple organizations.

                     <p>You can specify a candidate's readiness to assume a job
                        or position. For example, you can specify that a candidate is ready
                        now. You select a readiness level based on your knowledge of the candidate
                        and how well the candidate's current competencies match the skills
                        of the job or position.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can use the Candidate Ranking and Interim Successor
                        attributes to specify which of your candidates on a succession plan
                        are most capable of filling a vacant job. Using candidate ranking,
                        you can enter the order of preference for succession plan candidates
                        to fill the job associated with the plan when it becomes vacant. You
                        can have multiple candidates with the same rank across readiness categories.
                        For example, you can rank candidates across the entire plan, or you
                        can rank candidates within a readiness category.

                     <p>The readiness levels of all candidates in a plan
                        determines the bench strength for the job or position and your organization.
                        For example, if no candidate is likely to be ready in the next 2
                        years, the bench strength is poor. You can add candidates if this
                        is the case.

                  <p>Succession plans, talent pools, and talent review meetings together support the development of
                     selected workers to meet enterprise goals or fill key roles. You manage
                     succession plans and talent pools in the Succession Plans work area
                     (<span><span class="uicontrol">My Workforce</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Succession Plans</span></span>). You select succession plans and talent pools for a talent review
                     meeting when you select the meeting content in the Talent Review work
                     area (<span><span class="uicontrol">My Workforce</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Talent Review</span></span>).

                     <p>You can group workers in talent pools to manage their
                        development, training, and other goals. Using succession plans, you
                        can track the readiness of candidates for a specific job or  position. You can use talent
                        pools either with or without succession plans.

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Talent Pools Without Succession Plans</h3>
                     
                     <p>Typically, you use talent pools without succession
                        plans when worker development isn't tied to a particular role. For
                        example, you may create talent pools to track how high-potential workers
                        are progressing. These workers may move into various roles at different
                        rates.

                     <p>You can use talent pools with succession plans to
                        track the development of candidates for a specific job or position.
                        When you add candidates to a succession plan, you can also add them
                        to a talent pool. For example, you could create a talent pool of sales
                        people who could move into the sales director role. You assign development
                        goals to this talent pool and track progress during annual talent
                        review meetings. When the current sales director sets a retirement
                        date, you use the succession management plan to identify a replacement.

                     <p>When you set up a talent review meeting, you can
                        associate succession plans and talent pools with the meeting. During
                        the meeting, the selected talent pools and succession plans appear
                        on the meeting dashboard. You can drag and drop workers from the box
                        chart matrix to a talent pool or succession plan. You can also add
                        workers to a succession plan or talent pool that isn't associated
                        with the meeting. The available plans and pools are those that the
                        facilitators own.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can also create new talent pools and succession
                        plans from the meeting dashboard. However, you must add the newly
                        created pool or plan to the meeting outside the meeting dashboard
                        for it to appear on the meeting dashboard.

                     them to the meeting to evaluate candidates. Or, you can create the
