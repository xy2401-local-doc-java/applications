                  <p>A talent pool is an identified group of workers.
                     You use talent pools to manage the development of the pool members
                     for particular purposes. For example, a talent pool can include future
                     leaders of the organization. You can also include one or more talent
                     pools in a succession
                     plan to prepare pool members to fill a vacancy.

                     <p>You can use talent pools, for example, to:</p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Supply succession plans:</p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Create talent pools of potential
                                    candidates for succession plans. The pool members may be suitable
                                    for more than one succession plan. For example, you can maintain a
                                    talent pool of local managers from which you populate a succession
                                    plan for the district general manager position.
                                 </p>

                              <li>
                                 <p>Create a talent review meeting
                                    based on a talent pool specifically for planning successions. Managers
                                    nominate workers as succession candidates by adding them to a talent
                                    pool while preparing for, or during a typical talent review meeting. Then senior
                                    executives can schedule a talent review meeting with a review population
                                    created from that talent pool specifically to vet the nominated workers
                                    and assign them to succession plans as appropriate.

                  <p>You can add development goals to a talent pool to ensure
                     that all pool members achieve the goals for which the talent pool exists.
                     Add development goals to a talent pool when you manage talent pools
                     in the Succession Plans work area (<span><span class="uicontrol">My Workforce</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Succession Plans</span></span>).

                     <p>Only talent pool owners can add development goals to a talent pool.
                        The development goals must be in the goal library. Goals from the talent
                        pool appear automatically in the goals of talent pool members, who
                        can access them from their development plan on the My Career Development
                        page. Managers can access these goals in the Career Development work
                        area. Workers don't inherit goals from the talent pool if they already
                        have them.

                        When you add a worker to a talent pool, the worker
                        doesn't automatically inherit any goals already associated with the
                        talent pool. The worker inherits development goals that you add to
                        the talent pool after the worker becomes a member.

                     <p>Only a talent pool's owners can remove development
                        goals from the pool. Removing a development goal from the talent pool
                        doesn't remove it from talent pool members. To remove the goal from
                        a worker's development plan, you must delete it manually from the
                        worker's goals.
