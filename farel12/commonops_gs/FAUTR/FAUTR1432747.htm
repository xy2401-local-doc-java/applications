                        field. The name appears on the Talent Review meeting dashboard, and

                        additional features, the meetings that use that template are updated

                        one in case one isn't available. All facilitators can update meeting
                        information and the data under review. By default, the person creating
                        the meeting is a facilitator.

                     <p>Typically, participants are managers in the
                        organization under review. You aren't required to invite all managers
                        in the organization, even if those managers have reports in the review

                     <p>You can also invite managers outside the organization
                        to participate. For example, you can invite managers who recently
                        transferred from the organization.

                     <p> The business leader is usually the top manager of
                        the organization under review. The business leader is a meeting participant
                        and receives the same meeting notifications as other meeting participants.

                        of their reports in the review population. Reviewers can grant access
                        to managers who report to them directly to prepare content for their
                        own direct and indirect reports. These managers don't have to be meeting
                        participants or reviewers. In turn, they can enable their direct reports
                        to update profile data for their own reports.

                        in the review population or may be new to the organization. The application
