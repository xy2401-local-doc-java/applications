                        picture of worker strengths and weaknesses. You view the ratings on
                        an n-box, a box chart matrix, for the following ratings:

                        the ratings to review the data that is critical to your business process.
                        When you switch from one view to another, you can rate the workers
                        using different criteria on the alternate view.

                     <p>Any rating updates from the meeting appear in the

                        to distinguish them from other ratings, such those from a performance
                        evaluation.

                        or other categories. You can view an individual's data, including
                        performance and potential ratings, experience, education, licenses,
                        certifications, and willingness to relocate.
