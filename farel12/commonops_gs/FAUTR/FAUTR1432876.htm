                  <p>Talent review meeting facilitators can create,
                     assign, and manage tasks for action items arising from a talent review.
                     This topic describes administration details for task assignments.
                     It also describes who can edit tasks, and where. Everyone who has
                     access to the Manage Notes and Tasks page can view all tasks for the
                     review population, including those from previous talent reviews.

                     <p>You can create and assign tasks on the Talent Review
                        dashboard and Manage Notes and Tasks page.

                     <p>When you create tasks, you must select an assignee.
                        You can assign a task to anyone; you aren't restricted to assigning
                        tasks to meeting participants or the review population. You can select
                        any one person in the review population as the associated worker.
                        When you add a task to a selected worker on the Talent Review dashboard,
                        the worker is automatically the Associated Worker, and the worker's
                        manager is the Assignee. You can change those roles when you create
                        the task on the dashboard.
