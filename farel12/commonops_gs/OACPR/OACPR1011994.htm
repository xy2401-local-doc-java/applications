                        The default report displays a standard set of columns

                        details, you can customize the display of columns.

                     <p>Events trigger the audit process and the event
                        details are stored in the audit table. Along with audit history, you
                        can view which events triggered the changes to the object data within
                        a given period of time. However, for events to trigger the audit process
                        for the business objects, the objects must be enabled for auditing.

                     <p>For Oracle Applications Cloud, transactional events
                        trigger the audit process based on the create, update, and delete
                        operations. The attributes of the audited object data can be used
                        in lookups and foreign keys to display values in the audit history.
                        Oracle Applications Cloud supports displaying the audited information
                        as per the application's language settings.

                     <p>For Oracle Fusion Middleware products, events such
                        as failed sign in attempts are used as triggers. In absence of an
                        audit table, the information is stored in the sandbox and presented
                        only in English.

                        event types available in Oracle Applications Cloud. For details on

                              in the database. The audit report displays the name of the created
                              object, the name of the user who created the object, and the time
                              stamp.

                              The audit report displays both the old and updated values of the object,
                              the name of the user who updated it, and the time stamp.

                              from the database. The audit report displays the last value that the
                              object attributes contained and the name of the user who deleted the
                              object.
