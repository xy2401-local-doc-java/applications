                              automatically create a workflow task that gets routed to your approvers.
                              If an approver sends the task back to you for more information about
                              your transaction, your action is to provide the requested information.
                              When the transaction is ultimately approved or rejected, you simply
                              get a notification that requires no action from you.

                              is to approve or reject the transaction. Other options might be available;
                              for example, you can delegate the task so that someone else does the
                              approval for you.
