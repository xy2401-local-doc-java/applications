                  <p>Jurisdiction is a physical territory such as
                     a group of countries, country, state, county, or parish where a particular
                     piece of legislation applies. French Labor Law, Singapore Transactions
                     Tax Law, and US Income Tax Laws are examples of particular legislation
                     that apply to legal entities operating in different countries' jurisdictions.
                     Judicial authority may be exercised within a jurisdiction.

                     <p>For each legal entity, select an identifying
                        jurisdiction. An identifying jurisdiction is your first jurisdiction
                        you must register with to be allowed to do business in a country.
                        If there is more than one jurisdiction that a legal entity must register
                        with to commence business, select one as the identifying jurisdiction.
                        Typically the identifying jurisdiction is the one you use to uniquely
                        identify your legal entity.

                     <p>Income tax jurisdictions and transaction tax jurisdictions
                        do not represent the same jurisdiction. Although in some countries,
                        the two jurisdictions are defined at the same geopolitical level,
                        such as a country, and share the same legal authority, they are two
                        distinct jurisdictions.

                     <p>Create income tax jurisdictions to properly report
                        and remit income taxes to the legal authority. Income tax jurisdictions
                        by law impose taxes on your financial income generated by all your
                        entities within their jurisdiction. Income tax is a key source of
                        funding that the government uses to fund its activities and serve
                        the public.

                        and complexities of various taxes. Tax jurisdictions and their respective
                        rates are provided by suppliers and require periodic maintenance.

                        value added taxes.

                  <p>For example, the Internal Revenue Service is the authority
                     for enforcing income tax laws in United States. In some countries,
                     such as India and Brazil, you are required to print legal authority
                     information on your tax reports. Legal authorities are defined in
                     the Oracle Fusion Legal Entity Configurator. Tax authorities are a
                     subset of legal authorities and are defined using the same  setup
