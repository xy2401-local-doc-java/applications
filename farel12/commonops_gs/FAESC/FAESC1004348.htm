                     Oracle Fusion permits multiple item masters, however,
                     use this capability cautiously. If you acquire a company, there may
                     be value in keeping the old item master for a transition period. If
                     you manage your subsidiaries as separate businesses, there may be
                     reduced value in a single item master.

                  <p>An item organization defines an
                     item when inventory balances are not stored and inventory storage
                     or inventory movement is not reflected in the Oracle Fusion Applications.
                     For example, you would use an item organization in a retail scenario,
                     if you need to know the items that are listed by and sold through
                     each retail outlet even though inventory and transactions are recorded
                     in another system. In Oracle Sales Cloud, item organizations are used
                     to define sales catalogs.

                        owned by the legal entity of which the business unit is part. All
                        transactions are accounted for in the primary ledger of the legal
                        entity that owns the inventory.

                        <p>The figure below illustrates the
                           inventory owned by InFusion Air Quality legal entity. The InFusion
                           Air Quality legal entity is associated with the Air Compressors business
                           unit, which is associated with the two Air Compressors inventory organizations.
                           Therefore, InFusion Air Quality legal entity owns the entire inventory
                           in both the Dallas and Atlanta locations.

                     <p>A prerequisite to defining an inventory organization
                        is to define a facility schedule. Oracle Fusion Applications permit

                     <p>Facility schedules permit creating workday calendars
                        for inventory organizations that are used in the Oracle Fusion Supply
                        Chain Management product family. For example, use workday calendars
                        in the scheduling of cycle counts and calculating transit time.

                  <h2>Cost Organization: Explained</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Cost organizations are used
                     to establish cost accounting policies, data defaults, and user security
                     policies for Oracle Fusion Costing. A cost organization can potentially
                     be spread across several physical locations or inventory organizations.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>For example, you created inventory organizations for
                     your manufacturing facility, finished goods warehouse, and distribution
                     centers. Then, you used average costs for your items in the manufacturing
                     facility and the finished goods warehouse, but used standard costs
                     for the same items after they have moved to the distribution centers.
                     In this case, your enterprise has three inventory organizations, but
                     only two cost organizations.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Accounting and business needs determine the different
                     cost organizations, inventory organizations, and cost
                     book combinations required, as well as the cost profiles used to calculate
                     transaction costs.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>All inventory organizations grouped under a cost organization
                     must belong to the same legal entity. For every cost organization, you must designate
                     one of its inventory organizations as the item validation organization, which means that all items in the cost organization use the item
                     validation organization's units of measure for cost calculations.
                     Define one or more cost organizations to meet your operational structure
                     and reporting needs.
                  </p>

                     A cost organization generally represents a costing
                     department. Take costing departments into consideration when determining
                     the setup of departments in Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management
                     (HCM). No system dependencies on cost organizations and costing departments
                     are require the same setup.
