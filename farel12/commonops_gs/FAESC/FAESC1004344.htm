                     through the judicial system. Define a legal entity for each registered

                     assets, liabilities, expenses and income, pay transaction taxes, or

                     <p>In configuring your enterprise structure in Oracle
                        Fusion Applications, the contracting party on any transaction is always
                        the legal entity. Individual legal entities:
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Own the assets of the enterprise</p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Record sales and pay taxes on those
                              sales
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Make purchases and incur expenses</p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Perform other transactions</p>
                        </li>

                     <p>Legal entities must comply with the regulations of
                        jurisdictions, in which they register. Europe now allows for companies
                        to register in one member country and do business in all member countries,
                        and the US allows for companies to register in one state and do business
                        in all states. To support local reporting requirements, legal reporting
                        units are created and registered.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You are required to publish specific and periodic
                        disclosures of your legal entities' operations based on different
                        jurisdictions' requirements. Certain annual or more frequent accounting
                        reports are referred to as statutory or external reporting. These
                        reports must be filed with specified national and regulatory authorities.
                        For example, in the United States (US), your publicly owned entities
                        (corporations) are required to file quarterly and annual reports,
                        as well as other periodic reports, with the Securities and Exchange
                        Commission (SEC), which enforces statutory reporting requirements
                        for public corporations.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Individual entities privately held or held by public
                        companies do not have to file separately. In other countries, your
                        individual entities do have to file in their own name, as well as
                        at the public group level. Disclosure requirements are diverse. For
                        example, your local entities may have to file locally to comply with
                        local regulations in a local currency, as well as being included in
                        your enterprise's reporting requirements in different currency.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A legal entity can represent all or part of your
                        enterprise's management framework. For example, if you operate in
                        a large country such as the United Kingdom or Germany, you might incorporate
                        each division in the country as a separate legal entity. In a smaller
                        country, for example Austria, you might use a single legal entity
                        to host all of your business operations across divisions.
                     </p>

                  <p>Oracle Fusion Applications support the modeling
                     of your legal entities. If you make purchases from or sell to other legal entities, define
                     these other legal entities in your customer and supplier registers.
                     These registers are part of the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Architecture.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>When your legal entities are trading with each other,
                     represent them as legal entities and as customers and suppliers in
                     your customer and supplier registers. Use legal entity relationships
                     to determine which transactions are intercompany and require intercompany
                     accounting. Your legal entities can be identified as legal employers
                     and therefore, are available for use in Human Capital Management (HCM)
                     applications.

                     <p>All of the assets of the enterprise are owned
                        by individual legal entities. Oracle Fusion Financials allow your
                        users to enter legal entities on transactions that represent a movement
                        in value or obligation.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, a sales order creates an obligation
                        on the legal entity that books the order to deliver the goods on the
                        acknowledged date. The creation also creates an obligation on the
                        purchaser to receive and pay for those goods. Under contract law in
                        most countries, damages can be sought for both:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Actual losses, putting the injured
                              party in the same state as if they had not entered into the contract.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>What is called loss of bargain,
                              or the profit that would have made on a transaction.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>In another example, if you revalued your inventory
                        in a warehouse to account for raw material price increases, the revaluation
                        and revaluation reserves must be reflected in your legal entity's
                        accounts. In Oracle Fusion Applications, your inventory within an
                        inventory organization is managed by a single business unit and belongs
                        to one legal entity.

                     <p>A business unit  can process transactions on behalf of many
                        legal entities. Frequently, a business unit is part of a single legal
                        entity. In most cases, the legal entity is explicit on your transactions.
                        For example, a payables invoice has an explicit legal entity field.
                        Your accounts payables department can process supplier invoices on
                        behalf of one or many business units.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In some cases, your legal entity is inferred from
                        your business unit that is processing the transaction. For example,
                        Business Unit ACM UK has a default legal entity of InFusion UK Ltd.
                        When a purchase order is placed in ACM UK, the legal entity InFusion
                        UK Ltd is legally obligated to the supplier. Oracle Fusion Procurement,
                        Oracle Fusion Project Portfolio Management, and Oracle Fusion Supply
                        Chain applications rely on deriving the legal entity information from
                        the business unit.&lt;

                     <p>The division  is an area of management responsibility that can
                        correspond to a collection of legal entities. If wanted, you can aggregate
                        the results for your divisions by legal entity or by combining parts
                        of other legal entities. Define date-effective hierarchies for your
                        cost center or legal entity segment in your chart of accounts to facilitate
                        the aggregation and reporting by division. Divisions and legal entities
                        are independent concepts.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion General Ledger supports up to
                        three balancing
                        segments. Best practices recommend one segment represents your

                        to regulatory agencies, tax authorities, and investors. Accounting
                        for your operations means you must produce a balanced trial balance
                        sheet by legal entity. If you account for many legal entities in a
                        single ledger, you must:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Identify the legal entities within
                              the ledger.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Balance transactions that cross legal
                              entity boundaries through intercompany transactions.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Decide which balancing segments correspond
                              to each legal entity and assign them in Oracle Fusion General Ledger
                              Accounting Configuration Manager. Once you assign one balancing segment
                              value in a ledger, then all your balancing segment values must be
                              assigned. This recommended best practice facilitates reporting on
                              assets, liabilities, and income by legal entity.
                           </p>

                     <p>Represent your legal entities by at least one balancing
                        segment value. You may represent it by two or three balancing segment
                        values if more granular reporting is required. For example, if your
                        legal entity operates in multiple jurisdictions in Europe, you might
                        define balancing segment values and map them to legal reporting units. You
                        can represent a legal entity with more than one balancing segment
                        value. Do not use a single balancing segment value to represent more
                        than one legal entity.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In Oracle Fusion General Ledger, there are three
                        balancing segments. You can use separate balancing segments to represent
                        your divisions or strategic business units to enable management reporting
                        at the balance sheet level for each. This solution is used to empower
                        your business unit and divisional managers to track and assume responsibility
                        for their asset utilization or return on investment. Using multiple
                        balancing segments is also useful when you know at the time of implementation
                        that you are disposing of a part of a legal entity and want to isolate
                        the assets and liabilities for that entity.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Implementing multiple balancing segments requires
                        every journal entry that is not balanced by division or business unit,
                        to generate balancing lines. You cannot change to multiple balancing
                        segments after you begin using the ledger because your historical
                        data is not balanced by the new balancing segments. Restating historical
                        data must be done at that point. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If your enterprise regularly spins off businesses
                        or holds managers accountable for utilization of assets, identify
                        the business with a balancing segment value. If you account for each
                        legal entity in a separate ledger, no requirement exists to identify
                        the legal entity with a balancing segment value.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>While transactions that cross balancing segments
                        don't necessarily cross legal entity boundaries, all transactions
                        that cross legal entity boundaries must cross balancing segments.
                        If you make an acquisition or are preparing to dispose of a portion
                        of your enterprise, you may want to account for that part of the enterprise
                        in its own balancing segment even if the portion is not a separate
                        legal entity. If you do not map legal entities sharing the same ledger
                        to balancing segments, you cannot distinguish them using intercompany
                        functionality or track individual equity.

                        intercompany transactions and to assist in consolidation elimination
                        entries. These accounts are derived and automatically entered on your

                        <p>Your legal entities are required to pay payroll tax
                           and social insurance such as social security on your payroll. In Oracle
                           Fusion Applications, you can register payroll statutory units to pay
                           and report on payroll tax and social insurance for your legal entities.
                           As the legal employer, you might be required to pay payroll tax, not
                           only at the national level, but also at the local level. You meet
                           this obligation by establishing your legal entity as a place of work
                           within the jurisdiction of a local authority. Set up legal reporting
                           units to represent the part of your enterprise with a specific legal
                           reporting obligation. You can also mark these legal reporting units
                           as tax reporting units, if the legal entity must pay taxes as a result
                           of establishing a place of business within the jurisdiction.

                  <p>Payroll statutory units are legal entities that are
                     responsible for paying workers, including the payment of payroll tax
                     and social insurance. A payroll statutory unit can pay and report
                     on payroll tax and social insurance on behalf of one or many legal
                     entities, depending on the structure of your enterprise. For example,
                     if you are a multinational, multiple company enterprise, then you
                     register a payroll statutory unit in each country where you employ
                     and pay people. You can optionally register a consolidated payroll
                     statutory unit to pay and report on workers across multiple legal employers within
                     the same country. You associate a legislative data group with a payroll statutory unit to provide the correct payroll information
                     for workers.

                  <p>A legal employer is a legal entity that employs workers.
                     You define a legal entity as a legal employer in the Oracle Fusion

                  <p>Use a tax reporting unit to group workers
                     for the purpose of tax and social insurance reporting. A tax reporting
                     unit is the Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) version of
                     the legal reporting unit in Oracle Fusion Applications.

                  <p>To create a tax reporting unit, you use the Oracle
                     Fusion Legal Entity Configurator to define a legal entity as a payroll
                     statutory unit. When you identify a legal entity as a payroll statutory
                     unit, the application transfers the legal reporting units that are
                     associated with that legal entity to Oracle Fusion HCM as tax reporting
                     units. You can then access the tax reporting unit using the Manage
                     Legal Reporting Unit HCM Information task.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>If you identify a legal entity as a legal employer,
                     and not as a payroll statutory unit, you must enter a parent payroll
                     statutory unit. The resulting legal reporting units are transferred
                     to Oracle Fusion HCM as tax reporting units, but as children of the
                     parent payroll statutory unit that you entered, and not the legal
                     entity that you identified as a legal employer.

                  <p>Each of your legal entities has at least one legal reporting unit. Legal reporting units can also be referred to as establishments.
                     You can define either domestic or foreign establishments. Define legal
                     reporting units by physical location, such as sales offices, or by
                     logical unit, such as groups of employees subject to different reporting
                     requirements. For example, define logical legal reporting units for
                     both salaried and hourly paid employees.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Another example of logical reporting units is in Oracle
                     Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) where you use legal reporting
                     units to model tax reporting units. A tax reporting unit is used to
                     group workers for the purpose of tax reporting.

                     <p>Plan and define your legal reporting units at both
                        the local and national levels if you operate within the administrative
                        boundaries of a jurisdiction that is more granular than country. 
                        For example, your legal entity establishes operations in a country
                        that requires reporting of employment and sales taxes locally as well
                        as nationally. Therefore, you need more than one legally registered
                        location to meet this legal entity's reporting requirements in each
                        local area. Additionally, legal entities in Europe operate across
                        national boundaries, and require you to set up legal reporting units
                        for the purposes of local registration in each country. There can be multiple registrations
                        associated with a legal reporting unit. However, only one identifying
                        registration can be defined by the legal authority used for the legal
                        entity or legal reporting unit and associated with the legal reporting
                        unit.
