                  <p>Oracle Fusion Applications reference data sharing
                     feature is also known as SetID. The reference data sharing functionality
                     supports operations in multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses.
                     As a result, there is a reduction in the administrative burden and
                     the time to implement new business units. For example, you can share
                     sales methods, or transaction types across business units. You may
                     also share certain other data across asset books, cost organizations,
                     or project units.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The reference data sharing features use reference
                     data sets to which reference data is assigned. The reference data
                     sets group assigned reference data. The sets can be understood as
                     buckets of reference data assigned to multiple business units or other
                     application components.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC94313">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Reference Data Sets</h3>
                     
                     <p>You begin this part of your implementation by creating
                        and assigning reference data to sets. Make changes carefully as changes
                        to a particular set affect all business units or application components
                        using that set. You can assign a separate set to each business unit
                        for the type of object that is being shared. For example, assign separate
                        sets for payment terms, transaction types, and sales methods to your
                        business units.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Your enterprise can determine that certain aspects
                        of your corporate policy can affect all business units. The remaining
                        aspects are at the discretion of the business unit manager to implement.
                        This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each
                        business unit. For example, your enterprise holds business unit managers
                        accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital
                        requirements at a corporate level. In such a case, you can let managers
                        define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally.
                        In this example:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Each business unit has its own
                              reference data set for sales methods.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>One central reference data set
                              for payment terms is assigned to all business units.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>The reference data sharing is especially valuable
                        for lowering the cost of setting up new business units. For example,
                        your enterprise operates in the hospitality industry. You are adding
                        a new business unit to track your new spa services. The hospitality
                        divisional reference data set can be assigned to the new business
                        unit to quickly set up data for this entity component. You can establish
                        other business unit reference data in a business unit-specific reference
                        data set as needed.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC135205">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Reference Data Sharing Methods</h3>
                     
                     <p>Variations exist in the methods used to share data
                        in reference data sets across different types of objects. The following
                        list identifies the methods:
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Assignment to one set only, no common
                              values allowed. This method is the simplest form of sharing reference
                              data that allows assigning a reference data object instance to one
                              and only one set. For example, Asset Prorate Conventions are defined
                              and assigned to only one reference data set. This set can be shared
                              across multiple asset books, but all the values are contained only
                              in this one set.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Assignment to one set only, with common
                              values. This method is the most commonly used method of sharing reference
                              data that allows defining reference data object instance across all
                              sets. For example, Receivables Transaction Types are assigned to a
                              common set that is available to all the business units. You need not
                              explicitly assign the transaction types to each business unit. In
                              addition, you can assign a business unit-specific set of transaction
                              types. At transaction entry, the list of values for transaction types
                              includes the following:
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Transaction types from the set
                                    assigned to the business unit.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Transaction types assigned to the
                                    common set that is shared across all business units.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Assignment to multiple sets, no common
                              values allowed. The method of sharing reference data that allows a
                              reference data object instance to be assigned to multiple sets. For
                              instance, Payables Payment Terms use this method. It means that each
                              payment term can be assigned to one or more than one set. For example,
                              you assign the payment term Net 30 to several sets, but assign Net
                              15 to a set specific only to your business unit. At transaction entry,
                              the list of values for payment terms consists of only the set that
                              is assigned to the transaction's business unit.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>

                     <p>If you share your items across warehouses or manufacturing
                        facilities, you can access them through a common item master. Configure
                        one or multiple item masters for your enterprise, based your enterprise
                        structure. A single item master is recommended because it provides
                        simpler and more efficient maintenance. However, in rare cases, it
                        may be beneficial to keep multiple item masters. For example, if you
                        acquire another enterprise and want to continue to operate your lines
                        of business separately, maintaining a second item master might be
                        the best decision.

                     <p>You can approve particular suppliers to supply specified
                        commodities and authorize your business units to buy from those suppliers
                        when the need arises. For example, you might be a household cleaning
                        products manufacturer and need dyes, plastics, and perfumes to make
                        your products. You purchase from a central supplier 70% of your perfume
                        supplies with an additional supplier, in reserve, from whom you purchase
                        the remaining 30%. At the same time, each of your business units purchases
                        plastics and dyes from the same supplier, but from different local
                        supplier sites to save transportation costs.

                     <p>To implement business unit-specific supplier sites,
                        Oracle Fusion Procurement supports a method for defining suppliers
                        sites as owned and managed by the business unit responsible for negotiating
                        the supplier terms. Your other business units that have a service
                        provider relationship defined with your procurement business unit
