                  <h2>Shared Service Center: Points to Consider</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Oracle Fusion applications supports shared
                     service centers in two ways. First, with business unit security, which
                     allows your shared service centers personnel to process transactions
                     for other business
                     units called clients. This was the foundation of Multi Org
                     Access Control in the Oracle E-Business Suite.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Second, the service provider model expands
                     on this capability to allow a business unit and its personnel in a
                     shared service center to work on transactions of the client business
                     units. It is possible to view the clients of a service provider business
                     unit, and to view service providers of a client business unit.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Your shared service centers provide services to your
                     client business units that can be part of other legal entities. In such cases, your
                     cross charges and recoveries are in the form of receivables invoices,
                     and not merely allocations within your general ledger, thereby providing
                     internal controls and preventing inappropriate processing.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For example, in traditional local operations, an invoice
                     of one business unit cannot be paid by a payment from another business
                     unit. In contrast, in your shared service center environment, processes
                     allowing one business unit to perform services for others, such as
                     paying an invoice, are allowed and completed with the appropriate
                     intercompany accounting.  Shared service centers provide your users
                     with access to the data of different business units and can comply
                     with different local requirements.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC127314">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Security</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The setup of business units provides you with
                        a powerful security construct by creating relationships between the
                        functions your users can perform and the data they can process. This
                        security model is appropriate in a business environment where local
                        business units are solely responsible for managing all aspects of
                        the finance and administration functions.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In Oracle Fusion applications, the business functions your business
                        unit performs are evident in the user interface for setting up business
                        units. To accommodate shared services, use business unit security
                        to expand the relationship between functions and data. A user can
                        have access to many business units. This is the core of your shared
                        service architecture.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, you take orders in many businesses. Your
                        orders are segregated by business unit. However, all of these orders
                        are managed from a shared service order desk in an outsourcing environment
                        by your users who have access to multiple business units.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC162329">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Benefits</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>In summary, large, medium, and small enterprises
                        benefit from implementing share service centers. Examples of functional
                        areas where shared service centers are generally implemented include
                        procurement, disbursement, collections, order management, and human
                        resources. The advantages of deploying these shared service centers
                        are the following: 
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Reduce and consolidate the number
                              of control points and variations in processes, mitigating the risk
                              of error. 
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Increase corporate compliance to
                              local and international requirements, providing more efficient reporting.
                           </p>

                        <li>

                  <h2>Service Provider Model: Explained</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>In Oracle Fusion applications, the service
                     provider model defines relationships between business units for a specific business function, identifying one business in the relationship as a service provider
                     of the business function, and the other business unit as its client. 
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC127365">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Procurement Example</h3>
                     
                     <p>The Oracle Fusion Procurement product family has taken
                        advantage of the service provide model by defining outsourcing of
                        the procurement business function. Define your business units with
                        requisitioning and payables invoicing business functions as clients
                        of your business unit with the procurement business function. Your
                        business unit responsible for the procurement business function takes
                        care of supplier negotiations, supplier site maintenance, and purchase
                        order processing on behalf of your client business units. Subscribe
                        your client business units to the supplier sites maintained by the
                        service providers, using a new procurement feature for supplier site
                        assignment.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>In the InFusion example below, business unit four
                        (BU4) serves as a service provider to the other three business units
                        (BU1, BU2, and BU3.)  BU4 provides the corporate administration, procurement,
                        and human resources (HR) business functions, thus providing cost savings
                        and other benefits to the entire InFusion enterprise.
