      segregate them by their strategic objectives, and measure their results. Although related to your legal structure, the business
      organizational hierarchies do not have to be reflected directly in the legal structure of the enterprise. The management structure
      can include divisions, subdivisions, lines of business, strategic business units, profit, and cost centers. In the figure
      above, the management structure is shown on the Business Axis. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the management structure is
      implemented using divisions and business units as well as being reflected in the chart of accounts. Straddling the legal and
      business organizations is a functional organization structured around people and their competencies. For example, sales, manufacturing,
      and service teams are functional organizations. This functional structure is represented by the Functional Axis in the figure
      above. You reflect the efforts and expenses of your functional organizations directly on the income statement. Organizations
      must manage and report revenues, cost of sales, and functional expenses such as research and development and selling, general,
      and administrative expenses. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the functional structure is implemented using departments and
      organizations, including sales, marketing, project, cost, and inventory organizations."><script>window.ohcglobal || document.write('<script src="/en/dcommon/js/global.js">\x3C/script>')</script></head>

                        This functional list is called the Functional Axis. The overall image
                        suggests that information might, at a minimum, be tracked by company,

                        entities.

                     <p>Successfully managing multiple businesses
                        requires that you segregate them by their strategic objectives, and
                        measure their results. Although related to your legal structure, the
                        business organizational hierarchies do not have to be reflected directly
                        in the legal structure of the enterprise. The management structure
                        can include divisions, subdivisions, lines of business, strategic
                        business units, profit, and cost centers. In the figure above, the
                        management structure is shown on the Business Axis. In Oracle Fusion
                        Applications, the management structure is implemented using divisions
                        and business units as well as being reflected in the chart of accounts.

                        is a functional organization structured around people and their competencies.
                        For example, sales, manufacturing, and service teams are functional
                        organizations. This functional structure is represented by the Functional
                        Axis in the figure above. You reflect the efforts and expenses of
                        your functional organizations directly on the income statement. Organizations
                        must manage and report revenues, cost of sales, and functional expenses
                        such as research and development and selling, general, and administrative
                        expenses. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the functional structure
                        is implemented using departments and organizations, including sales,
                        marketing, project, cost, and inventory organizations.

                  <p>Organization classifications define the purpose
                     of the organization, whether it's a department, a division, or a legal
                     entity. In some enterprises, organization classifications overlap,
                     which means that the same organization can be assigned multiple classifications.
                     For example, one organization within an enterprise might be both a
                     project organization and a department. The classifications of organizations
                     vary according to business objectives, legal structure, industry,
                     company culture, size and type of growth. You can create organizations
                     in Oracle Fusion with one or more classifications to reflect your
                     enterprise structure.

                     <p>Define each organization in your enterprise
                        as a separate organization with a single classification to reflect
                        your enterprise structure and provide flexibility for expansion. The
                        advantage of setting up separate organizations is the ability to add
                        further organizations to expand the enterprise easily. For example,
                        if your enterprise acquires another company which has a different
                        line of business in a country in which you employ people, you can
                        create a division, a legal entity, and additional departments. Classify
                        the new legal entity as a legal employer and payroll statutory unit
                        for the company's payroll tax and social insurance.

                        if the organization has multiple purposes. For example, use an organization
                        within the Oracle Sales Cloud applications as a department that employs
                        salespeople and classify it as a department and a sales organization.
                        Or, if your enterprise operates and employs people in multiple countries,
                        create a legal entity for each country using the Manage Legal Entity
                        task. Then use the Manage Departments task to classify the legal entity
                        as a department.

                     poses questions about the name of your enterprise, legal structure,
                     management reporting structure, and primary organizing principle for

                     You can use or modify these answers to ensure that both your reporting
