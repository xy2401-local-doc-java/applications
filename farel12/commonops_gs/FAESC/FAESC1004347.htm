                  <p>The two important components to be considered
                     in designing your enterprise structure are cost centers and departments.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>A cost
                     center represents the smallest segment of an organization for
                     which you collect and report costs. A department is an organization
                     with one or more operational objectives or responsibilities that exist
                     independently of its manager and has one or more workers assigned
                     to it.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FAESC172903">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Cost Centers</h3>
                     
                     
                     <p>A cost center represents the destination or
                        function of an expense rather than the nature of the expense which
                        is represented by the natural account. For example, a sales cost center
                        indicates that the expense goes to the sales department.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A cost center is generally attached to a single legal
                        entity. To identify the cost centers within a chart of accounts structure
                        use one of these two methods:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Assign a cost center value in the
                              value set for each cost center. For example, assign cost center values
                              of PL04 and G3J1 to your manufacturing teams in the US and India.
                              These unique cost center values allow easy aggregation of cost centers
                              in hierarchies (trees) even if the cost centers are in different ledgers.
                              However, this approach requires defining more cost center values.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Assign a balancing segment value
                              with a standardized cost center value to create a combination of segment
                              values to represent the cost center. For example, assign the balancing
                              segment values of 001 and 013 with cost center PL04 to represent your
                              manufacturing teams in the US and India. This creates 001-PL04 and
                              013-PL04 as the cost center reporting values. The cost center value
                              of PL04 has a consistent meaning. This method requires fewer cost
                              center values to be defined. However, it prevents construction of
                              cost center hierarchies using trees where only cost center values
                              are used to report results for a single legal entity. You must specify
                              a balancing segment value in combination with the cost center values
                              to report on a single legal entity.
                           </p>
                        </li>

                        more operational objectives or responsibilities that exist independently
                        of its manager. For example, although the manager may change, the
                        objectives do not change. Departments have one or more workers assigned
                        to them.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A manager of a department is typically responsible
                        for:
                     </p>

                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>The manager of a sales department may also be responsible
                        for meeting the revenue targets.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The financial performance of departments is generally
                        tracked through one or more cost centers. In Oracle Fusion Applications,
                        departments are defined and classified as Department organizations.
                        Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) assigns workers to departments,
                        and tracks the headcount at the departmental level.

                     <p>The granularity of cost centers and their relationship
                        to departments varies across implementations. Cost center and department
                        configuration may be unrelated, identical, or consist of many cost
                        centers tracking the costs of one department.

                  <p>Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) uses trees to model organization
                     hierarchies. It provides predefined tree structures for department
                     and other organizational hierarchies that can include organizations

                        to report and forecast sales results. Salespeople are defined as resources

                           At the department level, two organizations with a classification of
                           Department are defined, the Marketing Department and Sales Department.
                           These two departments can be also identified as a Resource Organizations,

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Costing uses a cost organization
                        to represent a single physical inventory facility or group of inventory
                        storage centers, for example, inventory organizations. This cost organization can roll up to a manager with responsibility
                        for the cost center in the financial reports.

                     <p>A cost organization can represent a costing department.
                        Consider this relationship when determining the setup of departments
                        in HCM. No system dependencies are required for these two entities,
                        cost organization and costing department, to be set up in the same
                        way.

                  <p>Every project is owned by an organization
                     that's used for reporting, security, and accounting. An organization
                     can own specific types of projects, such as indirect projects, capital
                     projects, billable projects, and capital contract projects. For an
                     organization to be eligible to be a project or task owning organization,
                     you must assign the organization the Project Task Owning Organization
                     classification. Also, the organization must be assigned to the hierarchy
                     that you specify in the project implementation options for the business
                     unit. Assign project and task
                     owning organizations to project units to specify which organizations
                     are available to own the project.

                  <p>A project expenditure
                     organization can incur expenditures for projects and be used
                     as a planning and budgeting resource. Before you use an organization
                     for expenditures, you must assign it to the Project Expenditure Organization
                     classification. If you use organization hierarchies, assign the expenditure
                     organization to the hierarchy specified in the implementation options
                     for the business unit.
