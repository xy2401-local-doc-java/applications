                  <p>Thick versus thin general ledger is standard
                     terminology used to describe the amount of data populated and analysis
                     performed in your general ledger. Thick and thin are the poles; most
                     implementations are somewhere in between. Here are some variations
                     to consider:

                           can be obtained from the Projects system. In the thin general ledger,
                           business units, divisions, and individual departments are not represented
                           in the chart of accounts.

                                 Generally speaking, there is a trade-off between the
                                 volume of journals and balances created and maintained versus system
                                 resource demands. Actual performance depends on a wide range of factors
                                 including hardware and network considerations, transaction volume,
                                 and data retention policies.

                  <p>A chart
                     of accounts segment is a component of the account combination. Each
                     segment has a value set attached to it to provide formatting and validation
                     of the set of values used with that segment. The combination of segments
                     creates the account combination used for recording and reporting financial
                     transactions. Examples of segments that may be found in a chart of
                     accounts are company, cost center, department, division, region, account, product,
                     program, and location.
                  </p> 
                   <h3 class="topictitle">Value Sets and Values</h3> 
                  <p>The value
                     sets define the attributes and values associated with a segment
                     of the chart of accounts. You can think of a value set as a container
                     for your values. You can set up your flexfield so that it automatically
                     validates the segment values that you enter against a table of valid
                     values. If you enter an invalid segment value, a list of valid values
                     appears automatically so that you can select a valid value. You can
                     assign a single value set to more than one segment, and you can share
                     value sets across different flexfields.
                  </p> 
                  <div class="infobox-caution"><span class="notep1">Caution: </span>
                     You must use Independent validation only for the
                     Accounting Key Flexfield value sets. Other validations prevent you
                     from using the full chart of accounts functionality, such as data
                     security, reporting, and account hierarchy integration. Dependent
                     values sets are not supported.

                   <h3 class="topictitle">Segment Labels</h3> 
                  <p>Segment labels identify certain segments in your chart of accounts
                     and assign special functionality to those segments. Segment labels
                     were referred to as flexfield qualifiers in Oracle E-Business Suite.
                     Here are the segment labels that are available to use with the chart
                     of accounts.

                           second, and third balancing. The primary balancing segment label is

                           costs, they are useful for detailed analysis and reporting. Cost centers
                           are optional, but required if you are accounting for depreciation,
                           additions, and other transactions in Oracle Fusion Assets, and for

                     flow of the business process across both front and back-office operations
                     and addresses the needs of a global enterprise. The process of designing
                     the enterprise structure, including the accounting configuration,
                     is the starting point for an implementation. This process often includes
                     determining financial, legal, and management reporting requirements

                              structure. A ledger records the transactional balances by defining
                              a chart of accounts with a calendar and currency, and accounting rules, implemented
                              in an accounting method. The ledger is associated with the subledger
                              transactions for the business units that are assigned to it, and provides
                              context and accounting for them.

                              Second and Third balancing segments are used to implement management
                              reporting and analysis. Balancing segments provide automatic balancing
                              functionality by legal entity for journal entries, including intercompany

                              aggregates elements of natural expenses to identify functional costs.
                              A cost center can be the smallest segment of an organization for which
                              costs are collected and reported. Not all cost centers represent organizations.
                              A manager is assigned responsibility for cost control and is assigned
                              both a department and a cost center; in which case the cost center and department
                              might be identified with each other. However, a finance department
                              manager might have separate cost centers for finance cost and audit
                              costs and a Research and Development department manager might have
                              separate cost centers for research and development.
                           </p>
                           <p>Cost centers are represented by segment values in the chart of accounts
                              that indicate the functional areas of your business, such as accounting,
                              facilities, shipping, or human resources. You might keep track of
                              functional areas at a detailed level, but produce summary reports
                              that group cost centers into one or more departments. Cost center
                              values are also used by Oracle Fusion Assets to assist the managers
                              in tracking locations and accounting for assets assigned to their

                              in the ledger and subledgers. The account segment is mapped to a dimension

                           <p>For example, a business unit manager is responsible
                              for working capital utilization or overall asset utilization. You
                              identify the business unit as a balancing segment value, to enable
                              calculation of ratios for various utilization measurements.

                              A BU identifies the primary ledger that subledger transactions are
                              posted to, facilitating the use of more than one BU per general ledger.
                              Each business unit posts transactions to a single primary ledger.
                              For example, a shared service center handles all the procurement functions
                              for the entire company. The procurement transactions are posted to
                              the business unit's ledger with intercompany entries to other ledgers
                              as needed.

                              of its manager and that has one or more employees assigned to it.
                              The manager of a department is typically responsible for business
                              deliverables, personnel resource management, competency management,
                              and occasionally, for cost control and asset tracking.

                           <p>In Oracle Fusion Applications, departments can be set
                              up in Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM). If wanted, they
                              can also be represented by a unique segment in the chart of accounts
                              or a group of cost center values.
