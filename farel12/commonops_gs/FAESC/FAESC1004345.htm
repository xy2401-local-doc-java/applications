                  <p>Managing multiple businesses requires that
                     you segregate them by their strategic objectives and measure their
                     results.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Responsibility to reach objectives can be delegated
                     along the management structure. Although related to your legal structure,
                     the business organizational hierarchies do not reflect directly the
                     legal structure of the enterprise. The management entities and structure
                     can include:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>

                     <li>
                        <p>Lines of business</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Other strategic business units</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Their own revenue and cost centers</p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>These organizations can be included in many alternative
                     hierarchies and used for reporting, as long as they have representation
                     in the chart of
                     accounts.
                  </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Divisions</h3>
                     
                     <p>A division refers to a business-oriented subdivision
                        within an enterprise, in which each division organizes itself differently
                        to deliver products and services or address different markets. A division
                        can operate in one or more countries, and can be many companies or
                        parts of different companies that are represented by business units.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>A division is a profit center or grouping of profit
                        and cost centers, where the division manager is responsible for achieving
                        business goals including profits. A division can be responsible for
                        a share of the company's existing product lines or for a separate
                        business. Managers of divisions may also have return on investment
                        goals requiring tracking of the assets and liabilities of the division.
                        The division manager generally reports to a top corporate executive.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>By definition a division can be represented in the
                        chart of accounts. Companies can use product lines, brands, or geographies
                        as their divisions: their choice represents the primary organizing
                        principle of the enterprise. This may coincide with the management
                        segment used in segment reporting.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Oracle Fusion Applications supports a qualified management
                        segment and recommends that you use this segment to represent your
                        hierarchy of business units and divisions. If managers of divisions
                        have return on investment goals, make the management segment a balancing
                        segment. Oracle Fusion applications permit up to three balancing segments.
                        The values of the management segment can be business units that roll
                        up in a hierarchy to report by division.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Historically, divisions were implemented as a node
                        in a hierarchy of segment values. For example, Oracle E-Business Suite
                        has only one balancing segment, and often the division and legal entity
                        are combined into a single segment where each value stands for both
                        division and legal entity.
                     </p>

                     <p>Divisions are used in HCM to define the management
                        organization hierarchy, using the generic organization hierarchy.
                        This hierarchy can be used to create organization-based security profiles.

                  <p>A business unit is a unit of an enterprise
                     that performs one or many business functions that can
                     be rolled up in a management hierarchy. A business unit can process
                     transactions on behalf of many legal entities. Normally, it has
                     a manager, strategic objectives, a level of autonomy, and responsibility
                     for its profit and loss. Roll business units up into divisions if you structure your chart of accounts with this type of hierarchy.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>In Oracle Fusion Applications you do the following:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Assign your business units to one primary ledger. For
                           example, if a business unit is processing payables invoices, then
                           it must post to a particular ledger. This assignment is required for
                           your business units with business functions that produce financial
                           transactions.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Use a business unit as a securing
                           mechanism for transactions. For example, if you run your export business
                           separately from your domestic sales business, then secure the export
                           business data to prevent access by the domestic sales employees. To
                           accomplish this security, set up the export business and domestic
                           sales business as two separate business units.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>The Oracle Fusion Applications business unit model
                     provides the following advantages:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Enables flexible implementation</p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Provides consistent entity that controls
                           and reports on transactions
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Shares sets of reference data across
                           applications
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Business units process transactions using reference data sets that reflect your business rules and policies and can differ from
                     country to country. With Oracle Fusion Application functionality,
                     you can share reference data, such as payment terms and transaction
                     types, across business units, or you can have each business unit manage
                     its own set depending on the level at which you want to enforce common
                     policies.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>In countries where gapless and chronological sequencing
                     of documents is required for subledger transactions, define your business
                     units in alignment with your legal entities to ensure the uniqueness

                     <p>A number of Oracle Fusion Applications use business
                        units to implement data security. You assign roles like Accounts Payable
                        Manager to users to permit them to perform specific functions, and
                        you assign business units for each role to users to give them access
                        to data in those business units. For example, users which have been
                        assigned a Payables role for a particular business unit, can perform
                        the function of payables invoicing on the data in that business unit.
                        Roles can be assigned to users manually using the Security Console,
                        or automatically using provisioning rules. Business Units can be assigned
                        to users using the Manage Data Access for Users task in Setup and
                        Maintenance.

                     <p>Although there is no relationship implemented in Oracle
                        Fusion Applications, a business function logically indicates a presence
                        of a department in the business unit with people performing tasks
                        associated with these business functions. A business unit can have
                        many departments performing various business functions. Optionally,
                        you can define a hierarchy of divisions, business units, and departments as a tree over
                        HCM organization units to represent your enterprise structure.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                        This hierarchy definition is not required in the setup
                        of your applications, but is a recommended best practice.
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <p>Your enterprise procedures can require a manager of
                        a business unit to have responsibility for their profit and loss statement.
                        In such cases, any segment that allows the identification of associated
                        revenue and costs can be used as a profit center identification. 
                        The segment can be qualified as a cost center segment.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>However, there are cases where a business unit is
                        performing only general and administrative functions, in which case
                        your manager's financial goals are limited to cost containment or
                        recovering of service costs. For example, if a shared service center
                        at the corporate office provides services for more commercially-oriented
                        business units, it does not show a profit and therefore, only tracks
                        its costs.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In other cases, where your managers have a responsibility
                        for the assets of the business unit, a balance sheet can be produced.
                        The recommended best practice to produce a balance sheet is to setup
                        the business unit as a balancing segment in the chart of accounts.
                        The business unit balancing segment can roll up to divisions or other
                        entities to represent your enterprise structure.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When a business function produces financial transactions,
                        a business unit must be assigned to a primary ledger, and a default legal entity. Each
                        business unit can post transactions to a single primary ledger, but
                        it can process transactions for many legal entities.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following business functions generate financial
                        transactions and will require a primary ledger and a default legal
                        entity:

                     <p>Oracle Fusion applications facilitates independent
                        balance sheet rollups for legal and management reporting by offering
                        up to three balancing
                        segments. Hierarchies created using the management segment
                        can provide the divisional results. For example, it is possible to
                        define management segment values to correspond to business units,
                        and arrange them in a hierarchy where the higher nodes correspond
                        to divisions and subdivisions, as in the Infusion US Division example
                        above.

                  <p>For example, the business unit running the accounts
                     payable business function has at least one accounts payable department.

                  <p>Another example is a business unit running a sales
                     business function. This business unit has both sales and marketing

                  <p>Sales and marketing department hierarchies are maintained
                     in the Oracle Sales Cloud service using the resource manager functionality.
                     The department hierarchy used by Human Capital Management (HCM) can
                     overlap, align with, or differ from the Oracle Sales Cloud sales organization
                     hierarchy in both the number of levels and the organizational lines.

                  <p>Project units are operational subsets of an enterprise that
                     conduct business operations using projects and need to enforce consistent
                     project planning, management, analysis, and reporting. Project units
                     often represent lines of business, such as Consulting Services, Sales,
                     and Research and Development. You must set up at least one project
                     unit to use in Oracle Fusion Project Portfolio Management.

                     unit while sharing a single approach to financial management across
                     all project units. The following diagram shows two project units that
                     share a common approach to financial management and data. Each project
                     unit maintains separate reference data for managing projects.

                  <h2>Business Units and Projects: Explained</h2>
                  
                  <p>Business units are subsets of an enterprise that perform one
                     or more business functions and can be consolidated in both a managerial
                     and legal hierarchy. Project accounting is an example of a business
                     function that's set up by business unit. Other examples are billing
                     and revenue management, customer contract management, and payables
                     invoicing.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Business units are defined centrally. During implementation,
                     you must enable the Project Accounting business unit for use with
                     Project Financial Management applications.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>You can partition financial data using business units
                     while sharing a single approach to project management across all business
                     units. The following diagram shows two business units, one from the
                     United Kingdom (UK) and one from the United States (US). These business
                     units have the same research and development processes, so a single project unit is used
                     by both business units to facilitate common project management practices.
