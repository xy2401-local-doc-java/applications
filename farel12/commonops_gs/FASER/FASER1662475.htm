                  <p>Information about users and roles in your LDAP directory is available
                     automatically to Oracle Cloud Applications. However, in specific circumstances
                     you're recommended to run the Retrieve Latest LDAP Changes process.
                     This topic describes when and how to run Retrieve Latest LDAP Changes.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>You run Retrieve Latest LDAP Changes if you believe
                     data-integrity or synchronization issues may have occurred between
                     Oracle Cloud Applications and your LDAP directory server. For example,
                     you may notice differences between roles on the Security Console and
                     roles on the Create Role Mapping page. On-premises customers should
                     also run this process after applying monthly updates.

                  <p>A Security Console visualization graph consists
                     of nodes that represent security items. These may be users, roles,
                     privileges, or aggregate privileges. Arrows connect the nodes to define
                     relationships among them. You can trace paths from any item in a role
                     hierarchy either toward users who are granted access or toward the
                     privileges roles can grant.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>You can select either of two views:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Radial: Nodes form circular (or
                           arc) patterns. The nodes in each circle relate directly to a node
                           at the center of the circle. That focal node represents the item you
                           select to generate a visualization, or one you expand in the visualization.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Layers: Nodes form a series of
                           horizontal lines. The nodes in each line relate to one node in the
                           line above. This is the item you select to generate a visualization,
                           or one you expand in the visualization.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>For example, a job role might consist of several
                     duty roles. You might select the job role as the focus of a visualization
                     (and set the Security Console to display paths leading toward privileges):
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>The Radial view would initially
                           show nodes representing the duty roles encircling a node representing
                           the job role.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>The Layers view would initially
                           show the duty-role nodes in a line beneath the job-role node.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>You can then manipulate the image, for example by
                     expanding a node to display the items it consists of.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>As an alternative, you can generate a visualization
                     table that lists items related to an item you select. For example,
                     a table may list the roles that descend from a role you select, or
                     the privileges inherited by the selected role. You can export tabular
                     data to an Excel file.
