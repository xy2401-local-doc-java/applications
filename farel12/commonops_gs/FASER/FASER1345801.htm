                     <p>You secure data by provisioning roles that provide
                        the necessary access.

                     <p>Data roles also can be generated based on HCM security profiles. Data roles and HCM security profiles enable defining the instance sets specified
                        in data security policies.

                     <p>When you provision a job role to a user, the job role
                        limits data access based on the data security policies of the inherited
                        duty roles. When you provision a data role to a user, the data role
                        limits the data access of the inherited job role to a dimension of data.

                     <p>Data security consists of privileges conditionally granted to
                        a role and used to control access to the data. A privilege is a single,
                        real world action on a single business object. A data security
                        policy is a grant of a set of privileges to a principal on an object
                        or attribute group for a given condition. A grant authorizes a role,
                        the grantee, to actions on a set of database resources. A database
                        resource is an object, object instance, or object instance set. An
                        entitlement is one or more allowable actions applied to a set of database
                        resources.

                           data, such as people and departments. Data authorization for some
                           roles, such as the Manager role, is managed in HCM, even in ERP and
                           SCM applications. You can use HCM security profiles to generate grants
                           for a job role such as Manager. The resulting data role with its role
                           hierarchy and grants operates in the same way as any other data role.

                        data at rest. Advanced Data Security is available for Oracle Applications

                           users such as database and system administrators accessing and viewing
                           your application data. This feature restricts access to specific database
                           objects, such as the application tables and SOA objects.

                           requires access to the application tables, she can request temporary
                           access to the Fusion schema at which point keystroke auditing is enabled.

                           Applications data which is at rest on the file system from being read
                           or used. Data in the database files (DBF) is protected because DBF
                           files are encrypted. Data in backups and in temporary files is protected.
                           All data from an encrypted tablespace is automatically encrypted when
                           written to the undo tablespace, to the redo logs, and to any temporary

                           The Oracle Wallet is an encrypted container outside the database that
                           stores authentication and signing credentials, including passwords,
                           the TDE master key, PKI private keys, certificates, and trusted certificates
                           needed by secure sockets layer (SSL). Tablespace keys are stored in
                           the header of the tablespace and in the header of each operating system
                           (OS) file that makes up the tablespace. These keys are encrypted with
                           the master key which is stored in the Oracle Wallet. Tablespace keys
                           are AES128-bit encryption while the TDE master key is always an AES256-bit
                           encryption.

                           is entered in a text field in the data security user interface pages
                           and supports more complex filtering than an XML filter, such as nesting
                           of conditions or sub queries. An XML filter, unlike a SQL predicate,
                           is assembled from choices in the UI pages as an AND statement.

                     <h3>What's the difference between function security and data security?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Function security is a statement of what actions you can perform
                        in which user interface pages.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Data security is a statement of what action can be taken against
                        which data. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Function security controls access to user interfaces
                        and actions needed to perform the tasks of a job. For example, an
                        accounts payable manager can view invoices. The Accounts Payable Manager
                        role provisioned to the accounts payable manager authorizes access
                        the functions required to view invoices. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Data security controls access to data. In this example,
                        the accounts payable manager for the North American Commercial Operation
                        can view invoices in the North American Business Unit. Since invoices
                        are secured objects, and a data role template exists for limiting
                        the Accounts Payable Manager role to the business unit for which the
                        provisioned user is authorized, a data role inherits the job role to limit access to those invoices
                        that are in the North American Business Unit. Objects not secured
                        explicitly with a data role are secured implicitly by the data security
                        policies of the job role.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Both function and data are secured through role-based
                        access control.
                     </p>
