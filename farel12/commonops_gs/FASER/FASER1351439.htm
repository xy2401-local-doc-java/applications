                  <p>Oracle Procurement Cloud applications use
                     the standard role-based security model. Predefined security roles
                     are delivered for Procurement in the security reference implementation. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Some types of delivered roles are:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>

                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Abstract roles, for common functionality
                           that is not job-specific.

                        <p>Duty roles, that can carry both
                           function and data security grants.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>Discretionary roles, are like duty
                           roles but can be provisioned to users independent of job or abstract
                           roles.

                  <p>For each of the predefined roles, the included or
                     inherited duties grant access to application functions that correspond
                     to their responsibilities. In some areas of Procurement you must also
                     grant data access directly to specific users. For example, you must
                     directly set up users such as buyers, category managers and procurement
                     managers as procurement agents.

                     <p>Supplier user provisioning refers to the
                        process of establishing supplier users with access to Oracle Fusion
                        Supplier Portal (Supplier Portal). Your buying organization can create
                        and maintain user accounts, job roles, and data access controls for
                        supplier contacts. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The content supplier users can access, and tasks
                        they can perform, are controlled by your buying organization. You
                        can also allow supplier users to assume the responsibility for user
                        account management on behalf of your buying organization. To do this,
                        allow trusted supplier users to create and maintain user accounts
                        for their fellow employees that require access to the Supplier Portal.
                        Your buying organization can maintain control, and reduce their administrative
                        burden, by granting provisioning access to their trusted suppliers.

                           Manager, and Procurement Application Administrator.

                                 Only the IT Security Manager job role can add and remove roles. This
                                 helps your organization avoid the risk of adding an internal application
                                 job role inadvertently. It prevents suppliers from gaining unauthorized
                                 access to internal data. The supplier roles are added from the central
                                 Oracle LDAP roles repository which stores all Oracle Fusion application
                                 job roles. Once they add a role to the table, the role is immediately
                                 available for provisioning to supplier contacts by the Supplier Administrator.

                                 setup task. They manage settings for how the supplier job roles are
                                 exposed in provisioning flows. The first column controls whether a
                                 supplier job role can be provisioned in Supplier Portal, by supplier
                                 users with the SSA role.

                           usages, as they can access all functions on the setup page. However,
                           this task is typically performed by the Procurement Application Administrator.
                           The Procurement Application Administrator cannot add or remove roles
                           from the table.

                           which expedite supplier user account requests. To do this, identify
                           the minimum set of job roles that a supplier contact can be granted.
                           This prevents approvers from having to explicitly review and assign
                           job roles for each user account request.

                           Supplier Administrator (or approver) can review supplier contact user
                           account requests. This allows them to:

                           roles for other users. They can do this based on the following:

                        provisions user accounts to provide supplier contacts access to Oracle
                        Fusion Supplier Portal (Supplier Portal). The administrator performs
                        user account maintenance for a specific supplier contact in the Suppliers
                        work area, on the Edit Supplier page, Contacts tab. The administrator
                        assigns a user account with roles that determine what functions the
                        supplier contact can perform in the Supplier Portal.

                     <p>The following are Oracle Procurement Cloud flows where
                        a supplier administrator can request and manage a user account for
                        a supplier contact:

                              a supplier contact, the administrator can also request to create a
                              user account for the contact, request roles and grant data access.
                              A supplier user can also request for a supplier contact and user account
                              to be created.

                              user can also request a user account to be created for an existing

                              edit supplier contacts. A user account is part of a supplier contact.
                              The approver has the ability to create a user account and assign roles
                              within this flow.

                        this process. When the process is complete, the identity management system
                        sends notification to the supplier contact with the user name and
                        temporary password for Supplier Portal. If the process fails, a notification
                        is sent to the Supplier Administrator that a user account was not
                        successfully provisioned.

                        This determines the business objects and task flows the supplier user
                        can access. Supplier job roles should be assigned based on the job
                        that the contact performs within the supplier organization. For example,
                        Customer Service Representative or Accounts Receivable Specialist.

                     <p>Use the Data Access tab to control data security.
                        This determines which transactions the user can access for the specific
                        business objects their job role is associated with. The two levels
                        of data security are: Supplier and Supplier Site. By default, all
                        supplier user accounts start with Supplier level, meaning they can
                        access all transactions belonging to their supplier company only.
                        For more restrictive access, the Supplier Site level limits user access
                        to transactions for specific supplier sites only.

                        the Self Service Administrator can Provision:</h4>
                        <p>Vision Corporation currently grants selected supplier
                           users access to agreements only. The corporation determines that all
                           supplier users should also be granted access to orders, shipments,
                           receipts, invoices and payments information by default.
                        </p>
                        <p>The Procurement Application Administrator navigates
                           to the Manage Supplier User Roles page. They select the Allow Supplier
                           to Provision option for all supplier roles in the table. This allows
                           the Supplier Self Service Administrator to provision users with these
                           roles in the Supplier Portal.
                        </p>
                        <p>The corporation also decides the Supplier Sales Representative
                           role should not be marked as a default role. The Procurement Application
                           Administrator ensures the Default for Supplier Portal option is not
                           selected for that role.
                        </p>
                        <p>Vision Corporation also recently implemented Oracle
                           Fusion Sourcing. They must provision the Supplier Bidder role to specific
                           suppliers invited to sourcing events. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The IT Security Manager must ensure the Supplier
                           Self Service Administrator is not allowed to provision this role as
                           it must be controlled by Vision Corporation. The IT Security Manager
                           adds the Supplier Bidder role to the table. For the newly added role,
                           they leave the Allow Supplier to Provision option not checked, and
                           check the Default Roles for Sourcing option.
