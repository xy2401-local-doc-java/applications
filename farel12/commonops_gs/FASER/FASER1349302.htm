                     <p>Data Access Sets secure access to ledgers,
                        ledger sets, and portions of ledgers using primary balancing segment
                        values. If you have primary balancing segment values assigned to a
                        legal entity, then you can use this feature to secure access to specific
                        legal entities.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can combine ledger and ledger set assignments
                        in single data access sets if the ledgers share a common chart of
                        accounts and calendar. If you have primary balancing segment values
                        assigned to a legal entity within the ledger, then you can use data
                        access sets to secure access to specific legal entities. You can also
                        secure access to primary balancing segments assigned directly to the
                        ledger.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When a ledger or ledger set is created, a data access
                        set for that ledger or ledger set is automatically created, giving
                        full read and write access to those ledgers. You can also manually
                        create data access sets to give read and write access, or read-only
                        access to entire ledgers or portions of the ledger represented as
                        primary balancing segment values.

                        <p>Whenever you assign segment value security roles
                           to a user, the rules from the user's assigned roles can be applied
                           together. All of the segment value security roles assigned to a user
                           pertaining to a given value set are simultaneously applied when the
                           user works with that value set. For example, one rule provides access
                           to cost center 110 and another rule provides access to all cost centers.
                           A user with both of these segment value security rules has access
                           to all cost centers when working in a context where that value set
                           matters.

                     <p>You can set up segment value security rules

                        for chart of accounts segments. Segment value security rules restrict
                        data entry, online inquiry, and reporting.

                           create a complete data security policy that restricts segment value

                                 For this scenario, you can create two roles, one for the cost center
                                 segment and one for the account segment.

                                 you create roles Accounting Cost Center-SVS Role and US Revenue Account-SVS
                                 Role.

                                 Center-SVS Role.

                                 access to the Accounting cost center.

                     Use conditions to specify the segment values
                     that require security.
                     <p>Segment value security rules
                        that provide access to all segment values, and segment value security
                        rules that provide access to single nonparent segment values, don't
                        need a condition. Instead, you can define the policy to cover all
                        values, and you can define a policy to cover a single nonparent segment
                        value provided that you know the internal ID for that segment value.
                        If you don't know the internal ID, you can create a condition for
                        that single segment value.

                        create all of the conditions, except for the access to all cost centers,
                        which the policy definition can cover.

                     <p>Segment value security rules are specified for a

                        at the moment. In other words, segment value security rules are cumulative
                        or the union of all the segment value security rules you have assigned
                        to you through your roles. If you have one role assigned to your user
                        that only grants access to cost center 200, and another role that
                        grants access to cost centers 300 through 500, then you can access
                        to cost centers 200 and 300 through 500.

                           value security rules assignments both going to the same role. This
                           setup is used to more easily illustrate the difference in security
                           behavior for features directly and indirectly related to the balances

                           Storage Server. A wallet file is a digital file that stores your master
                           encryption key. The application uses your master encryption key to

                           isn't considered sensitive. The process uses a third-party payment

                           to replace sensitive data in the applications and database fields.
                           Unlike encryption, tokens can't be reversed mathematically to derive
                           the actual credit card number.

                           uses a chain key approach. The chain key approach is used for data

                           encryption key encrypts the subkeys and the subkeys encrypt the payment
                           instrument data. This approach allows easier rotation of the master

                           be rotated, or generated, which also encrypts subkeys, but doesn't
                           result in encrypting the credit card or bank account numbers again.

                        To protect your credit card and external bank account information,
                        you can enable encryption. Encryption encodes sensitive data, so it
                        can't be read or copied. To enable encryption, you must create a wallet
                        file. A wallet file is a digital file that stores your master encryption
                        key, which the application uses to encrypt your sensitive data.

                        Intelligence Catalog is secured by OTBI Transactional Analysis Duty

                        job role and OTBI Transactional Analysis duty role that are required
                        for creating custom reports using the subject areas. The OTBI Transactional
                        Analysis duty role is inherited by the job role. Use this table to
                        verify that your users have the job roles necessary to create custom
                        reports using subject areas.

                        the Business Intelligence Author role, enabling users with those job
