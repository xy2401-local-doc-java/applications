                     This guide explains how to enable user access to ERP functions and
                     data. You perform some of the tasks in this guide either only or mainly
                     during implementation. Most, however, can also be performed later
                     and as requirements change. This topic summarizes the scope of this
                     guide and identifies the contents of each chapter.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To manage roles, use the Security Console and other
                     tasks available in the Setup and Maintenance work area. You may use
                     either of these options to create or customize roles, or to view and
                     work with them later; the choice is a matter of your preference. Some
                     chapters in this guide discuss the use of Setup and Maintenance tasks,
                     and later chapters discuss the use of the Security Console.

                     As of Release 12, data roles are no longer used in
                     Oracle ERP Cloud. References in this guide to data roles are only
                     applicable to Oracle HCM Cloud. See the Oracle ERP Cloud and Oracle
                     SCM Cloud Security Upgrade Guide (Document 2211555.1 on My Oracle

                     such as <span class="uicontrol">Accounts Payable Manager</span> and <span class="uicontrol">General Accounting Manager</span>. You can use these roles, modify them after creating a copy of the
                     predefined role, or create new job roles as needed. A user can be
                     assigned more than one role, so don't define a role that includes
                     all the accesses needed for every user.

                  <p>Segregation of duties (SOD) separates activities
                     such as approving, recording, processing, and reconciling results
                     so you can more easily prevent or detect unintentional errors and
                     willful fraud.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Oracle ERP Cloud includes roles that have been defined
                     with a knowledge of a set of SOD policies that are included in the
                     Oracle Cloud's Access Controls Governor product. The job roles are
                     based on those commonly defined in business and the duty definitions
                     are defined using the Oracle Cloud SOD policies. 
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For example, the privilege <span class="uicontrol">Create Payments</span> is incompatible with the privilege <span class="uicontrol">Approve Invoice</span>. The predefined <span class="uicontrol">Accounts Payable Manager</span> role has the privileges
                     of <span class="uicontrol">Force Approve Invoices</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Create Payments</span>. When you assess and balance
                     the cost of duty segregation against reduction of risk, you may determine
                     that the <span class="uicontrol">Accounts Payable Manager</span> role is not allowed to perform force approve invoices and remove
                     this privilege.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>To learn more about the policies and roles, see the

                     <p>Job roles represent the jobs that users perform in
                        an organization. General Accountant and Accounts Receivables Manager

                        The predefined duty roles represent logical groupings
                        of privileges that you may want to manage as a group. They also represent
                        real-world groups of tasks. For example, the predefined General Accountant job role inherits the

                        job role with no access to reporting structures, you could copy the

                  <p>Aggregate privileges are a type of role.
                     Each aggregate privilege combines a single function security privilege
                     with related data security policies. All aggregate privileges are
                     predefined.
                  </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Aggregate Privilege Names</h3>
                     
                     <p>An aggregate privilege takes its name from the function
                        security privilege that it includes. For example, the Manage Accounts
                        Payable Accounting Period Status aggregate privilege includes the
                        Manage Accounting Period Status function security privilege.
                     </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Aggregate Privileges in the Role Hierarchy</h3>
                     
                     <p>Job roles and abstract roles inherit aggregate privileges directly. Duty roles may also inherit aggregate
                        privileges. However, aggregate privileges can't inherit other roles
                        of any type. As most function and data security below the level of
                        job and abstract roles is provided by aggregate privileges, the role
                        hierarchy has few levels and is consequently easy to manage.
                     </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Use of Aggregate Privileges in Custom Roles</h3>
                     
                     <p>You can include aggregate privileges in the role
                        hierarchy of a custom role. Treat aggregate privileges as role building
                        blocks.
                     </p>
                     
                  </div>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Customization of Aggregate Privileges</h3>
                     
                     <p>On the Security Console, you can't create, edit,
                        or copy aggregate privileges, nor can you grant the privileges from
                        an aggregate privilege to another role. The purpose of an aggregate
                        privilege is to grant a function security privilege only in combination
                        with a specific data security policy. Therefore, you must use the
                        aggregate privilege as a single entity.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p> If you copy a job or abstract role, then the source
                        roles' aggregate privileges aren't copied, even if you select the <span class="uicontrol">Copy top role and inherited roles</span> option.
                        Instead, role membership is added automatically to the aggregate privilege
                        for the copied role.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Security Console enforces the recommended approach
                        to aggregate privileges, which is that you use them as supplied.
                     </p>

                  <p>If the predefined security reference
                     implementation doesn't fully represent your enterprise, then you can make changes.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For example, the predefined Line Manager abstract role includes
                     compensation management privileges. If some of your line managers
                     don't handle compensation, then you can create a custom line manager
                     role without those privileges. To create a custom role, you can either
                     copy an existing role or create a role from scratch.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>During implementation, you evaluate the predefined
                     roles and decide whether changes are needed. You can identify predefined
                     application roles easily by their role codes, which all have the prefix ORA_. For example, the role code of the Payroll Manager
                     application job role is ORA_PAY_PAYROLL_MANAGER_JOB. All predefined roles are granted many function security privileges
                     and data security policies. They also inherit aggregate privileges
                     and duty roles. To make minor changes to a role, copying and editing
                     the predefined role is the more efficient approach. Creating roles
                     from scratch is most successful when the role has very few privileges
                     and you can identify them easily.
