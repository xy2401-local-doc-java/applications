                  <h2>Implementation Users: Explained</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The initial user can perform all the necessary
                     setup tasks. She can also perform security tasks, including resetting
                     passwords and the granting of additional privileges to herself and
                     to others. After you sign in the first time, you can create additional
                     implementation users with the same broad setup privileges that Oracle
                     provides to the initial user. If you prefer, you can restrict the
                     privileges of these implementation users based on your own setup needs.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The setup or implementation users are typically different
                     from the Oracle Applications Cloud application users. For example:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Setup users are usually not part
                           of your Oracle Applications Cloud organization.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>You don't assign them product-specific
                           work or make it possible for them to view product-specific data.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>You do, however, have to give them the necessary
                     privileges they require to complete application setup. You provide
                     these privileges through role assignment.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Your application includes several types of roles.
                     A job role, such as the IT Security Manager role, corresponds to a
                     specific job that a person does in the organization. An abstract role,
                     such as the Employee role, corresponds to general categories of people
                     in an organization. You assign both types of roles to users in the
                     security console. For the setup users, these roles are:
                  </p>
                  
                  <p></p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Application Diagnostic Administrator</p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Application Implementation Consultant</p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Employee</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>IT Security Manager</p>
                     </li>

                  <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                     The Application Implementation Consultant role has
                     unrestricted access to large amounts of data. Limit assignment of
                     the Application Implementation Consultant abstract role to implementation
                     users who perform a wide range of implementation tasks and move the
                     setup data across environments. Use other administrator roles such
                     as the Financials Applications Administrator for users required to
                     perform specific implementation tasks.
                     
                  </div>
                  
                  <p>There is nothing to stop you from providing the same
                     setup permissions to users that are part of the organization, if you
                     need to. Highly privileged implementation users are not the only users
                     who can do setup. You can create administrative users who don't have
                     such broad permissions, yet can configure product-specific structures
                     and perform other related setup tasks.
                  </p>

                  <p>As the service administrator for the Oracle
                     ERP Cloud service, you're sent sign-in details when your environments
                     are provisioned. This topic summarizes how to access the service for
                     the first time and set up implementation users to perform the implementation.
                     You must complete these steps before you release the environment to
                     your implementation team.

                  <div class="infobox-tip"><span class="notep1">Tip: </span>
                     Create implementation users in the test environment
                     first. Migrate your implementation to the production environment only
                     after you have validated it. With this approach, the implementation
                     team can learn how to implement security before setting up application
                     users in the production environment.

                     <p>The service activation mail from Oracle provides
                        the service URLs, user name, and temporary password for the test or
                        production environment. Refer to the e-mail for the environment that
                        you're setting up. The Identity Domain value is the environment name.
                        For example, ERPA could be the production environment and ERPA-TEST
                        could be the test environment.

                     <p>Sign in to the test or production Oracle ERP Cloud
                        service using the service home URL from the service activation mail. The URL ends with either <span class="uicontrol">AtkHomePageWelcome</span> or <span class="uicontrol">FuseWelcome</span>.

                     <p>When you first sign in, use the password in the service
                        activation mail. You're prompted to change the password and answer
                        some challenge questions. Make a note of the new password. You must
                        use it for subsequent access to the service.

                  <p>An administrator may use the Security Console
                     to lock users' accounts. When an account is locked, its user cannot
                     sign in. He or she must either use the "forgot password" flow to reset
                     the password or contact the help desk to have the account unlocked.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>You can lock a user account in either of two ways.
                     In either case, open the User Accounts page and search for the user
                     whose account you want to lock.

                  <p>Users may receive e-mail notifications of
                     user-account events, such as account creation or password expiration.
                     These notifications are generated from a set of templates, each of
                     which specifies an event. A template generates a message to a user
                     when that user is involved in the event tied to the template.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>To work with templates, select the Administration
                     tab in the Security Console, and then the Notifications tab in the
                     Administration page.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>There are eight events, and a predefined template
                     exists for each event. Only one template linked to a given event can
                     be enabled at a time. So to use notification templates, you need do
                     nothing more than ensure that notifications are enabled. To do that,
                     see that the Enable Notifications check box is selected in the Notification
                     Preferences region of the Notifications Administration page.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Even so, you can enable or disable templates, edit
                     them, or create templates to replace existing ones. To create a template:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Click the Add Template button in
                           the Notifications Administration page.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Enter a name for the template and,
                           optionally, a description.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Select an event. When you do, values
                           for Message Subject and Message are copied from an already-configured
                           template for which the same event is selected.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Edit the message subject, message
                           text, or both. Note that message text may include tokens, which are
                           replaced in run time by literal values appropriate for a given user
                           or account.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Select the Enabled check box if
                           you want to use the template immediately. If you do, the application
                           automatically disables the template that had been enabled for that
                           event. Or, leave the check box cleared to hold the template in reserve.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Click Save and Close.</p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ol>
                  
                  <p>To edit a template, click its name in the Notifications
                     Administration page. Then follow essentially the same process as you
                     would to create a template. Note, however, that you cannot modify
                     the event selected for a template that has been saved. You may enable
                     or disable an individual template by selecting or clearing its Enabled
                     check box as you edit it.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>You can disable, but cannot delete, predefined templates.
                     You can delete custom templates. To do so, click the x icon in the
                     row for a template in the Notifications Administration page. Then
                     respond to a confirmation message. If you delete a template that had
                     been enabled, no other template is enabled automatically.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>You can use the following tokens in the message text
                     for a template:
                  </p>
