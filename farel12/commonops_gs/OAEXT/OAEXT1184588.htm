                  <p>A flexfield is an extensible set of placeholder fields associated
                     with business objects and placed on the application pages. You can
                     use flexfields to extend the business objects and meet enterprise
                     data management requirements without changing the data model or performing
                     any database programming. Flexfields help you to capture different
                     data on the same database table.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>For example, an airline manufacturer may require
                     specific attributes for its orders that aren't predefined. Using a
                     flexfield for the order business object, you can create and configure
                     the required attribute.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Flexfields that you see on the application pages
                     are predefined. However, you can configure or extend the flexfields,
                     or modify their properties. Users see these flexfields as field or
                     information attributes on the UI pages. To use flexfields, search
                     for and open the <span class="uicontrol">Define Flexfields</span> task list in the Setup and Maintenance work area. You can use the
                     following tasks contained within it:
                  </p>

                           to your business. You can use a descriptive flexfield to collect custom
                           invoice details on a page displaying invoices.
                        </p>

                           only when the contextual data conditions are fulfilled. Thus, extensible
                           flexfields provide more flexibility than the descriptive flexfields.

                  <p>Configuring a flexfield ranges from identifying
                     the need for extending a business object with custom attributes to
                     integrating the custom attributes into the deployment. In the case
                     of key flexfields, configuring the flexfield involves identifying
                     value set assignments and determining segment structures.

                        key codes comprised of meaningful parts according to your business
                        practices. You configure the key flexfield to have one segment for
                        each part that makes up your key code.

                     <p>A segment is a field within a flexfield and represents
                        a single table column of your database. When configuring a flexfield,
                        define the appearance and meaning of individual segments. Segments
                        represent attributes of information. Segments can appear globally
                        wherever the flexfield is implemented, or based on a structure or
                        context. Each segment captures a single atomic value and represents
                        an attribute of information.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The characteristics of a segment vary based on the
                        type of flexfield in which it's used.
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>In key flexfields, a segment describes
                              a characteristic of the entity. For example, a part number that contains
                              details about the type, color, and size of an item.
                           </p>

                              of which are global while the remaining are contextually dependent
                              on the category of the device.

                        flexfield structure is a specific configuration of segments. Adding
                        or removing segments, or rearranging their order, produces a different
                        structure. You can reuse the segments that are based on the database
                        columns, in multiple structures.

                        the flexfield generates the ADF business components so that the run

                        import and export flexfields across the implementation site. The deployment
                        status must be either Deployed or Deployed to sandbox. Therefore,
                        before you attempt migration, verify and ensure that a flexfield is
                        successfully deployed.

                     <p>The latest definitions of a flexfield reflect on the
                        user interface at run time only if the flexfield is deployed. When
                        the user interface accesses a business object, the deployed flexfield
                        definition identifies the attributes associated with the captured
                        values. On a page, if you add display customizations for a flexfield
                        using Oracle Composer, the same flexfield segments can appear differently
                        on different pages.

                           be configured. Therefore, application development registers flexfields
                           so that they are available to administrators and implementation consultants
                           for configuration. The registration involves reserving columns of
                           entity tables for use in flexfields. For more information about registering
                           flexfields, see Oracle Fusion Applications Developer's Guide.

                        <p>Before you begin planning flexfields, determine
                           what type is appropriate to your needs, and which business objects
                           are available for customizing flexfields. All flexfields consist of
                           segments which represent attributes of an entity. The value a user
                           enters for an attribute is stored in a column of the entity table.
                           Carefully plan flexfields before configuring them. Before configuring
                           new segments for your flexfields, be sure to plan their implementation
                           carefully.

                        <p>If you have determined that a business object supports
                           flexfields, and those flexfields have been registered, you can begin
                           planning their configuration. Note the code name of the flexfield
                           you intend to configure so that you can find it easily in the Define
                           Flexfield activity. In some cases you can customize how the flexfield
                           appears on the page. See Oracle Applications Cloud Help for specific
                           products to determine any restrictions on using product-specific flexfields.

                           You can create value sets while creating descriptive
                           and extensible flexfield segments. However, define value sets before
                           configuring key flexfield segments that use them, because you assign
                           existing value sets while configuring key flexfield segments.

                           segments, you can optionally specify to display the description of
                           the selected value to the right of the segment at run time. You can
                           assign sequence order numbers to global segments and to context-sensitive
                           segments in each context. Segment display is always in a fixed order
                           based on the segments' sequence numbers. You cannot enter a number
                           for one segment that is already in use for a different segment. Therefore,
                           you may consider numbering the segments in multiples, such as 4, 5,
                           or 10, to make it easy to insert new attributes.

                           first to ensure that the intended column isn't automatically assigned

                        <p>The flexfield attributes that you define integrate
                           with the user interface pages where users access the attributes' business
                           object. Application development determines the UI pages where business
                           objects appear and the display patterns used by default to render
                           flexfield segments.

                        <p>After a flexfield has been deployed to the mainline
                           MDS repository so that it appears on application pages, you can customize
                           it on a per-page basis using Page Composer. For example, you can hide
                           a segment, change its prompt or other properties, or reorder the custom
                           global attributes so that they are interspersed with the core attributes
                           in the same parent layout. You can customize the appearance of descriptive
                           and extensible flexfield segments in the UI page using Page Composer,
                           once the flexfield is deployed to the mainline metadata.

                           you can provide different translations for translatable text, such
                           as prompts and descriptions. Enter translations using the locale that
                           requires the translated text. In the global area, click your user
                           name and from the <span class="uicontrol">Settings and Actions</span> menu, select <span class="uicontrol">Set Preferences</span>. Then change the text to the translated text for that locale.

                           have been saved but not yet deployed also appear as disabled.

                           value. You can use range validation to ensure this relationship.

                     <p>Value sets are specific to your enterprise. When gathering information
                        using flexfields, your enterprise's value sets validate the values that your users
                        enter based on how you defined the value set. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can assign a value set to any number of flexfield segments in the same or different flexfields. Value set usage information
                        indicates which flexfields use the value set.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following aspects are important in understanding
                        how flexfields and value sets work together:

                        <p>As a key flexfield guideline, define value sets before
                           configuring the flexfield, because you assign value sets to each segment
                           as you configure a flexfield. With descriptive and extensible flexfields,
                           you can define value sets when adding or editing a segment.
                        </p>

                           Ensure that changes to a shared value set are compatible
                           with all flexfield segments that use the value set.

                        <p>When you change a value in a shared value set, the
                           change affects the value set for all flexfields that use that value
                           set. The advantage of a shared value set is that a single change propagates
                           to all usages. The drawback is that the change shared across usages
                           may not be appropriate in every case.

                           the value set values screen in the Manage Value Sets task, configure
                           the Value Set Values descriptive flexfield. The object's code is FND_VS_VALUES_B.This
                           flexfield expects the context code to correspond to the value set
                           code. For each value set, you can define a context whose code is the
                           value set code, and whose context-sensitive segments are shown for
                           the values of that value set. By default, the context segment is hidden
                           since it maps to the value set code and is not expected to be changed.

                           for all value sets. However, this would be quite unusual since it
                           would mean that you want to capture that attribute for all values
                           for all value sets.

                     <p>To populate a flexfield segment with a default
                        value when a row is created, specify a default type of constant or
                        parameter and a default value.

                     <p>To synchronize a segment's value with another field's
                        value whenever it changes, specify the derivation value to be the
                        flexfield parameter from which to derive the attribute's value. Whenever
                        the parameter value changes, the attribute's value is changed to match.
                        If you derive an attribute from a parameter, consider making the attribute
                        read-only, as values entered by users are lost whenever the parameter
                        value changes.

                     <p>When defaulting or deriving a default value from a
                        parameter, only those attributes designated by development as parameters
                        are available to be chosen.

                     <p>Different combinations of making the segments read
                        only or editable in combination with the default or derivation value

                        user interface. If the default value isn't read only, users can modify
                        it. However, if the segment value is a derived value, a user-modified
                        segment value is overwritten when the derivation value changes.

                     <p>A flexfield can have multiple usages. However, the
                        first table registered for a flexfield indicates the master usage.
                        Segments are based on the master usage. Other usages of the same table
                        for the same flexfield use the same segment setup, though the column
                        names may have a differentiating prefix.

                        <p>For extensible flexfield contexts, you can configure
                           a different usage. The usage of an extensible flexfield context determines
                           the scenarios or user interfaces in which the segments of a context
                           appear to end users. For example, the Supplier page displays an extensible
                           flexfield's supplier usage and the Buyer page for the same flexfield
                           displays the buyer usage. Then, a context that is associated only
                           with the supplier usage appears only on the Supplier page and not
                           on the Buyer page.

                        exposed by Oracle ADF services and used by SOA composites. Flexfields
                        are deployed for the first time during the application provisioning
                        process. After you configure or change a flexfield, you must deploy
                        it to make the latest definition available to users.

                        and business rule integration. For example, you can now write business

                        in the flexfield-enabled sandbox. If changes are needed, you return
                        to the Define Flexfield tasks to change the flexfield definition.

                     <p>When you deploy a flexfield to sandbox, the process
                        reads the metadata about the segments from the database,
                        generates flexfield Application Development Framework (ADF) business
                        component artifacts based on that definition, and stores in the sandbox
                        only the generated artifacts derived from the definition.

                     <p>When you deploy a flexfield sandbox, the process
                        generates the name of the flexfield sandbox, and that flexfield sandbox
                        is set as your current active sandbox. When you next sign in to the
                        application, you can see the updated flexfield configurations. The
                        Oracle Fusion Applications global area displays your current session
                        sandbox.

                        Unlike a standalone sandbox created using the Manage

                        the single flexfield. You can manage flexfield sandboxes, such as
                        setting an existing flexfield sandbox as active or deleting it, using
                        the Manage Sandboxes tool.

                     <p>A value set is a group of valid values that you assign to a flexfield segment to control the values that are stored for business object attributes.</p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>An end user enters a value for an attribute of a business
                        object while using the application. The flexfield validates the value against
                        the set of valid values that you configured as a value set and assigned
                        to the segment. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, you can define a required format, such
                        as a five digit number, or a list of valid values, such as green,
                        red, and blue. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Flexfield segments are usually validated, and typically
                        each segment in a given flexfield uses a different value set. You
                        can assign a single value set to more than one segment, and you can
                        share value sets among different flexfields.
                     </p>

                        As a flexfield guideline, define value sets before
                        configuring the flexfield, because you can assign value sets to each
                        segment as you configure a flexfield. With descriptive and extensible
                        flexfield segments, you can create value sets when adding or editing
                        a segment on the run time page where the flexfield appears.

                           defined an independent value set that you apply to another segment
                           in the same flexfield. Use a dependent value set to limit the list

                           defined for a related independent segment. The available values in

                           you define a dependent value set of cities in the USA with values
                           such as San Francisco and Los Angeles that are valid for the independent
                           value CA. Similarly, New York City and Albany are valid for the independent
                           value NY. In the UI, only the valid cities can be selected for a given
                           state.

                        <p>Because you define a subset value set from an existing

                        <p>Typically, you use a table-validated set when
                           the values you want to use are already maintained in an application
                           table, such as a table of supplier names. Specify the table column
                           that contains the valid value. You can optionally specify the description
                           and ID columns, a WHERE clause to limit the values to use for your
                           set, and an ORDER BY clause.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you specify an ID column, then the flexfield saves
                           the ID value, instead of the value from the value column, in the associated
                           flexfield segment. If the underlying table supports translations,
                           you can enable the display of translated text by basing the value
                           set's value column on a translated attribute of the underlying table. You
                           should also define an ID column that is based on an attribute that
                           isn't language-dependent so that the value's invariant ID (an ID that
                           doesn't change) is saved in the transaction table. The run time displays
                           the corresponding translated text from the value column for the run
                           time session's locale.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Table validation lets you enable a segment to depend
                           upon multiple prior segments in the same context structure. You cannot
                           reference other flexfield segments in the table-validated value set's
                           WHERE clause. That is, the WHERE clause cannot reference SEGMENT.segment_code
                           or VALUESET.value_set_code.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Table-validated value sets have unique values across
                           the table, irrespective of bind variables. The WHERE clause fragment
                           of the value set is considered if it doesn't have bind variables.
                           If it has bind variables, the assumption is that the values are unique
                           in the value set. If you use table validated value sets for key flexfields,
                           then you can't use all integration functionalities supported for key
                           flexfields, such as:

                           represents the low end of the range and another segment represents

                        <p>You can use one of the following types of
                           lists to specify the valid values for a segment:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>

                              <p>Custom list. Also include a sub
                                 list.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Dependent custom list</p>
                           </li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>If the valid values exist in a table column, use
                           a table value set to specify the list of values. To limit the valid
                           values to a subset of the values in the table, use a SQL WHERE clause.
                           Table value sets also provide some advanced features, such as enabling
                           validation depending on other segments in the same structure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Use an independent value set to specify a custom
                           set of valid values. For example, you can use an independent value
                           set of Mon, Tue, Wed, and so forth to validate the day of the week.
                           You can also specify a subset of an existing independent value set
                           as the valid values for a segment. For example, if you have an independent
                           value set for the days of the week, then a weekend subset can be composed
                           of entries for Saturday and Sunday.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Use a dependent value set when the available values
                           in the list and the meaning of a given value depend on which independent
                           value was selected for a previously selected segment value. For example,
                           the valid holidays depend on which country you are in. A dependent
                           value set is a collection of value subsets, with one subset for each
                           value in a corresponding independent value set.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For lists of values type value sets, you can additionally
                           limit the valid values that an end user can select or enter by specifying
                           format, minimum value, and maximum value. For list of values type
                           value sets, you can optionally implement value set data security.
                           If the Oracle Fusion applications are running in different locales,
                           you might need to provide different translations for the values and
                           descriptions.
                        </p>

                     <div class="sect3" id="OAEXT1167681">
                        <h4 class="topictitle">Plain Text Input</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Use a format-only value set when you want
                           to allow end users to enter any value, as long as that value conforms
                           to formatting rules. For example, if you specify a maximum length
                           of 3 and numeric-only, then end users can enter 456, but not 4567
                           or 45A. You can also specify the minimum and maximum values, whether
                           to right-justify, and whether to zero-fill. With a format-only value
                           set, no other types of validation are applied.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can use either a format-only, independent,
                           or dependent value set to specify a range of values. For example,
                           you might create a format-only value set with Number as the format
                           type where the end user can enter only the values between 0 and 100.
                           Or, you might create a format-only value set with Date as the format
                           type where the end user can enter only dates for a specific year,
                           such as a range of 01-JAN-93 to 31-DEC-93. Because the minimum and
                           maximum values enforce these limits, you need not define a value set
                           that contains each of these individual numbers or dates.

                        <p>The segment must have a sequence number that is less
                           than the sequence number of the segment with this bind variable. If
                           more than one segment is assigned to the value set, the closest prior
                           matching segment will be used to resolve the bind expression. A matching
                           segment must exist in the current flexfield context.

                        <p>This bind variable is useful when the set of valid
                           values depends on the value in another segment and that segment code
                           can vary, such as when the value set is used for more than one context
                           or flexfield. For example, the values to select from a CITIES table
                           might depend upon the selected country. If the value set for the segment
                           that contains the country value is COUNTRIES, then the WHERE clause
                           for the CITIES table might be <code>&lt;country_code&gt;
                              = :{VALUESET.COUNTRIES}</code>.

                     <p>This process uploads a flat file containing value set values for flexfields. You can use
                        this scheduled process to upload a file containing values you want to edit or add to an
                        existing independent or dependent value set. This process is useful
                        for adding or updating large volumes of value set value data in an
                        automated or recurring fashion. For example, you can upload a hundred
                        values on a recurring basis when scheduled as a recurring process.
                        This method may be more efficient than using the one-time Import action
                        in the Manage Value Sets tasks in the Setup and Maintenance work area.
                        However, for an ad hoc task of uploading a hundred values, it may
                        be quicker to use the Import action in the relevant tasks.

                     <h3>Translating Flexfield and Value Set Configurations: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>When you first configure a flexfield or segment, the translatable
                        text that you enter, such as prompts and descriptions, is stored as
                        the text for all installed locales. You may then provide a translation
                        for a particular locale. If you don't provide a translation for a
                        given locale, then the value that was first entered is used for that
                        locale.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>To translate the text for a particular locale, log
                        in with that locale or specify the locale by selecting <span><span class="uicontrol">Settings and Actions</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Personalization</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Set Preferences</span></span> in the global area. Then,
                        update the translatable text in the flexfield using the Manage Descriptive
                        Flexfields task, Manage Key Flexfields task, or Manage Extensible
                        Flexfields task. Your modifications change the translated values only
                        for the current session's locale.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>After you complete the translations, deploy the flexfield.</p>
                     
                     <p>You can define translations for a dependent value
                        set or an independent value set, if it is of type Character with a
                        subtype of Translated text. You define the translations by setting
                        the current session to the locale for which you want to define the
                        translation and using the Manage Value Sets task to enter the translated
                        values and descriptions for that locale. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For a table value set for which the underlying table
                        supports multiple languages and for which the value set's value column
                        is based on a translated attribute of the underlying table, you can
                        define translated values using the maintenance task for the underlying
                        table. For more information on using multilanguage support features,
                        see the Oracle Fusion Applications Developer's Guide.

                        <p>Value set security is a feature that enables you to secure
                           access to value set values based on the end user's role in the system. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>As an example, suppose you have a value set of US
                           state names. When this value set is used to validate a flexfield segment, and users
                           can select a value for the segment, you can use value set security
                           to restrict them to selecting only a certain state or subset of states
                           based on their assigned roles in the system.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, Western-region employees may choose only
                           California, Nevada, Oregon, and so on as valid values. They cannot
                           select non-Western-region states. Eastern-region employees may choose
                           only New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and so on as valid values, but
                           cannot select non-Eastern-region states. Value set security is implemented
                           using Oracle Fusion Applications data security.

                        <p>When you define or edit a flexfield segment, you specify
                           a default value from the values provided by the value set assigned to that segment.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can set the default value for a descriptive flexfield
                           segment to be a parameter, which means the entity object attribute
                           to which the chosen parameter is mapped provides the initial default
                           value for the segment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can set the default value to be a constant, if
                           appropriate to the data type of the value set assigned to the segment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to an initial default value, you can set
                           a derivation value for updating the attribute's value every time the
                           parameter value changes. The parameter you choose identifies the entity
                           object source attribute. Any changes in the value of the source attribute
                           during run time are reflected in the value of the segment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the display type of the segment is a check box,
                           you can set whether the default value of the segment is checked or
                           unchecked.

                     <p>Once you have identified a flexfield to configure,
                        plan the configuration in advance. Compile a list of the UI pages
                        and other artifacts in your deployment that are affected by the configuration.
                        Verify that you are provisioned with the roles needed to view and
                        configure the flexfield. View the flexfield using the Highlight Flexfields
                        command in the Administration menu while viewing the run time page
                        where the flexfield appears. Plan how you will deploy the flexfield
                        for test and production users. Review the tools and tasks available
                        for managing flexfields, such as the Define Flexfields task list,
                        Manage Sandboxes, and Highlight Flexfields for adding and editing
                        flexfield segments.

                           by its global, context, and context-sensitive segments. Plan a global
                           segment that captures an attribute for every instance of the business
                           object. Plan a context for segments that depend on a condition of
                           situation applying to a particular instance of the business object.
                           Plan context-sensitive segments to capture attributes that are relevant
                           in the context.

                           flexfields. If you have more than one group of custom attributes where
                           you could use the context segment, you will have to pick one group
                           over the others, based on your company's needs and priorities, and
                           add the other custom attributes as global segments.

                        <p>When you deploy a business intelligence-enabled descriptive
                           flexfield, the deployment process generates an additional set of flattened
                           Application Development Framework (ADF) business components in addition
                           to the usual ADF business components and ADF faces run time artifacts
                           that are generated during deployment. The flattened business components
                           include attributes for business intelligence-enabled segments only.
                           Flattening means each custom column in each context shows up as an
                           attribute in an Oracle Business Intelligence folder. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Flattened components include one attribute for the
                           BI-enabled context-segment, and one attribute for each business intelligence-enabled
                           global segment. For BI-enabled context-sensitive segments, consider
                           the following: 
                        </p>

                              <p>If you assigned a label to the
                                 segment, the flattened components include an additional single attribute
                                 representing segments with that label.
                              </p>

                              <p>If you didn't assign a label, the
                                 flattened components include a discrete attribute for each BI-enabled

                        <p>You can simplify reporting by representing similar
                           segments as a single logical object in Business Intelligence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you assign a label to any set of context-sensitive
                           segments that serve the same purpose in different contexts, you can
                           consolidate or equalize the segments into a single attribute. This
                           prevents duplication and the extra workload and complexity that result
                           from the flattening process. For example, a United States context
                           might have a Passport segment and a Canada context might have Visa
                           segment. If you assign the NationalID segment label to both the Passport
                           and Visa segments, they are equalized into the same NationalID attribute
                           in the flattened business component.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Non-labeled context-sensitive segments aren't equalized
                           across context values, so the flattened components include a separate
                           attribute for each context-sensitive segment for each context value.
                           It may not be possible to equalize similarly labeled segments if they
                           have incompatible data types or value set types.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Assign a label to a global segment, context segment,
                           or context-sensitive segment to map the corresponding attribute in
                           the flattened components to a logical object in Oracle Business Intelligence.
                           Using labels to map segments to BI logical objects minimizes the steps
                           for importing the flexfield into Oracle Business Intelligence.

                           Assigning a label to a context-sensitive segment serves
                           to equalize the attribute across contexts, as well as map the equalized
                           attribute to business intelligence.

                           segments or create new labels for assignment, as needed. Specify a
                           code, name, and description to identify each label. In the BI Object
                           Name field, enter the name of the logical object in Oracle Business
                           Intelligence to which the segment label should map during import.
                           Specifying the BI logical object minimizes the steps for importing
                           the flexfield into Oracle Business Intelligence and helps to equalize
                           context-sensitive segments across contexts.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If no labels are assigned to a BI-enabled segment,
                           or the BI Object Name on the assigned label doesn't exist in business
                           intelligence, you must manually map the segment to the desired logical

                        entity, the segments are displayed as a table. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Unlike descriptive flexfields, the extension columns
                        corresponding to extensible flexfields segments are part of extension
                        tables, separate from the base application table. Unlike descriptive
                        flexfield contexts, the set of attributes in an extensible flexfield
                        context remains constant and doesn't differ by context value. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>An extensible flexfield describes an application entity,
                        with the run time ability to expand the database that implementation
                        consultants can use to define the data structure that appears in the
                        application.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Extensible flexfields support one-to-many relationships
                        between the entity and the extended attribute rows.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To get a list of predefined extensible flexfields,
                        open the Setup and Maintenance work area, and use the Manage Extensible
                        Flexfields task.

                        <p>As with descriptive flexfields, you can define
                           multiple usages for an extensible flexfield, which enables several
                           application tables to share the same flexfield. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, a flexfield for shipping options can
                           be used by both a Supplier table and a Buyer table. In addition, you
                           can associate a context with one, some, or all of the flexfield's
                           usages. Thus, with the shipping information example, you can associate
                           a warehouse context with the Supplier usage, a delivery location context
                           with the Buyer usage, and a ship-via context with all usages.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Usages include security
                           information for applying no security to user access or enforcing view
                           and edit privileges. Some product-specific extensible flexfields have
                           specialized usage fields beyond those for security.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can configure multiple extensible flexfield
                           contexts and group the contexts into categories. All extensible flexfields
                           have at least one category. For some extensible flexfields, you can
                           configure a hierarchy of categories. A child category in the hierarchy
                           can inherit contexts from its parent category.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can define categories for extensible flexfields,
                           and you can associate any combination of contexts with a given category.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the Electronics and Computers category
                           hierarchy might include a Home Entertainment category, which in turn
                           might include an Audio category and a TV category, and so on. The
                           Home Entertainment product might have contexts that specify voltage,
                           dimensions, inputs and outputs. Contexts are reusable within a given
                           extensible flexfield. For example, the dimensions context could be
                           assigned to any category that needs to include dimensional information.

                     <p>Once you have identified a flexfield to configure,
                        plan the configuration in advance. Compile a list of the UI pages
                        and other artifacts in your deployment that are affected by the configuration.
                        Verify that you are provisioned with the roles needed to view and
                        configure the flexfield. View the flexfield using the Highlight Flexfields
                        command in the Administration menu while viewing the run time page
                        where the flexfield appears. Plan how you will deploy the flexfield
                        for test and production users. Review the tools and tasks available
                        for managing flexfields, such as the Define Flexfields task list,
                        Manage Sandboxes, and Highlight Flexfields for adding and editing
                        flexfield segments.

                           option and you plan to use translatable contexts, then also create
                           the generic actions for the translation data security resource. For
                           example, if the Item flexfield supports the translatable option and
                           has a data security resource ITEM_EFF_VL in addition to the base data
                           security resource ITEM_EFF_B, then create actions for both data security
                           resources, such as EDIT_NONTRANS_ATTRS for ITEM_EFF_B and EDIT_TRANS_ATTRS
                           for ITEM_EFF_VL.

                        <p>Each context is displayed to end users as
                           a region containing its context-sensitive segments. You can specify
                           instruction help text to display instructions that explain how to
                           use the region and its attributes to end users. Instruction help text
                           is displayed at the top of the context region. A context can be defined
                           as single row or multi row. Single row contexts are the same as descriptive flexfields contexts. A single row context has only one set of context-sensitive segments. A multi-row context enables you to associate multiple sets of values
                           with the same object instance.

                        <p>For example, for a BOOK table, you could create a multi
                           row context named chapters that contains a segment for chapter and
                           a segment for number of pages. Multiple chapters can then be associated
                           with each book in the BOOK table.

                        <p>For contexts that store multiple rows, you can uniquely
                           identify each row by having the values in each row form a unique key.

                           the hierarchy to reuse contexts for similar entities, such as similar
                           items in a product catalog.

                           text entered by end users is stored in the language of the user's
                           locale, and different translations of that text can be stored in other languages.
                           Segments in the translated contexts should utilize format-only value
                           sets for storing free-form, user-entered text.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Set the context security to give an end user view
                           or edit access to a context. The context's task flow and region appear
                           in the user interface only for users with view access. With edit access,
                           an end user can edit the context's attribute values. With no action
                           specified for a usage, no special privileges are enforced through

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Categories</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>A category is a grouping of related data items
                           that can be considered to belong together. You can associate any combination
                           of contexts with a given category. Extensible flexfields with more
                           than 30 categories must be deployed as a background process.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>A category hierarchy logically organizes a set of
                           categories. For example, the Electronics and Computers category hierarchy
                           might include a Computer category and a Home Entertainment category,
                           which in turn might include an Audio category and a TV category, and
                           so on.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A category can be a child or sibling of an existing
                           category. The hierarchy can be as simple or as complex as desired,
                           with any combination of zero or more sibling categories and zero or
                           more child categories. If no category is defined, the data items are
                           grouped under a single predefined default category. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Each category has associated contexts that store relevant
                           information about a data item in that category. For example, a Home
                           Entertainment product has contexts that specify Voltage, Dimensions,
                           Inputs and Outputs. Contexts are reusable within a given extensible
                           flexfield. Then, the Dimensions context could be assigned to any category
                           that needs to include dimensional information.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If a hierarchy includes child categories, each child
                           category inherits the contexts from its parent category; for example,
                           the Home Entertainment category inherits Voltage and Dimensions from
                           the Electronics and Computers category. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Each extensible flexfield is associated with a particular
                           category hierarchy. Consider category hierarchies to be defining framework
                           for extensible flexfields and their contexts. A category hierarchy
                           specifies which contexts are valid for each category.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>An extensible flexfield can include multiple contexts
                           which you define to support a given category. These contexts can be
                           suitable for various purposes, but within a particular category, some
                           contexts might be considered to be related to, or dependent on, each other.
                           You can combine these contexts into groups known as logical pages,
                           and determine the sequence in which the pages appear. This serves
                           to connect the contexts so they will always be presented together
                           and in a particular order in the application user interface. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the Home Entertainment category might
                           have an Electrical Specifications page that contains the Voltage,
                           Inputs and Outputs contexts, and a Physical Specifications page that
                           contains the Dimensions and Form Factor contexts.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can designate an extensible flexfield
                           segment as indexed so that it's one of the selectively required attributes
                           a user can use in an attribute search. If you indicate in the Manage
                           Extensible Flexfield UI page that a segment should be indexed, the
                           column representing the segment must be added to the database index.
                           Commonly, a database administrator (DBA) adds columns to the database
                           index.

                        <p>When an extensible flexfield with indexed segments
                           is deployed, search task flows are generated along with the other
                           flexfield artifacts and specify the indexed attributes as selectively required.
                           In the deployed extensible flexfield's search task flow, an end user
                           must specify at least one of the indexed attributes in the search
                           criteria. This prevents non-selective searches, which could cause
                           performance issues. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, if you index the memory and processor
                           attributes and ensure that the corresponding columns in the database
                           are indexed, a user can search an item catalog for computers by entering
                           processor or memory or both as a search criteria. No search is performed
                           if an end user enters an attribute that isn't indexed as a search
                           criterion.

                     <p>Categories are a way of extending the number
                        of context-sensitive segments for a flexfield beyond the columns reserved
                        for flexfield segments.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>An Items extensible flexfield has a category for
                        each item and each category can have one or more contexts. The laptop
                        item belongs to the Computers category. Since extensible flexfields
                        are mapped to separate extension tables, not just to columns as with
                        descriptive flexfields, the thirty reserved columns on the extensible
                        flexfield table let you define up to thirty context-sensitive segments
                        for each context.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you add a Dimensions context to the Computers
                        category, thirty segments are available. But if you need to add more
                        than thirty attributes, create another context and associate it to
                        the same category. You could now add an Electronics Attributes context
                        to the same Computers category in which you create another thirty
                        segments. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can continue creating more contexts and adding
                        them to the Computers category. In this way your laptop computer item
                        can be extended with as many attributes as you need, because it is
                        mapped to a category and you can keep adding contexts to that category.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A descriptive flexfield on an items table with thirty
                        columns reserved for segments can only have a single context. Once
                        you configure the columns for that one context, you cannot create
                        any more segments.

                           and pages with that category. If a product-specific extensible flexfield
                           is preconfigured with several categories, associate your contexts
                           and pages with those categories. If the extensible flexfields provide
                           user interfaces for configuring multiple categories, associate a context
                           with more than one category using inheritance.

                        key flexfields to ensure that your applications operate correctly.
                        You configure and maintain key flexfield definitions with the Manage
                        Key Flexfields task. To get a list of predefined key flexfields, open
                        the Setup and Maintenance work area, and use the Manage Key Flexfields
                        task. For information about specific key flexfields, see the help
                        for the product where the associated business component is implemented.

                        <p>Based on the flexfield metadata, actual part numbers
                           are captured at run time as a combination of segment values and stored
                           in a combinations table. A combinations table contains all the segment
                           columns for a flexfield, a unique ID column, and a structure instance
                           number column. The structure instance number column differentiates
                           multiple arrangements of the segment columns. For example, a part
                           number containing multiple segments can be represented by a key flexfield.
                           A part number key flexfield has a corresponding combinations table.
                           In that table, the flexfield stores a list of the complete codes,
                           with each segment of the code in a column, with the corresponding
                           unique ID and structure instance number for the code. When users define
                           a new part number or maintain existing part numbers in the parts catalog,
                           they directly maintain rows in the combinations table.

                        <p>The foreign key table contains a different business
                           entity than the combinations table. For example, the business entity
                           in the foreign key table is order lines or invoice lines that contain
                           foreign key references to parts for ordering. Any number of foreign
                           key tables can reference a particular entity represented by a key
                           flexfield.

                        <p>Applications identify a particular segment for some
                           purpose such as security or computations. Segment name or segment
                           order cannot reliably identify a segment because key flexfield segments
                           can be configured to appear in any order with any prompts. A segment label
                           functions as a tag for a segment. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the requirement is to identify which
                           segment in the accounting flexfield contains balancing information
                           and which segment contains natural account information. A segment label
                           determines which segment you are using for natural account information.
                           When you define your accounting flexfield, you must specify which
                           segment label apply to which segments. Some labels must be unique,
                           and cannot be applied to more than one segment in each structure.
                           Other labels are required, and must be applied to at least one segment
                           in each structure.

                        <p>A segment label helps a user searching for segments,
                           such as the Cost Center label for all segments across key flexfields

                        <p>In some applications, different users like to see
                           different segment structures for the same flexfield. A key flexfield
                           can have multiple structures if registered to support more than one
                           structure.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The flexfield can display different fields for different
                           users based on a data condition in your application data, such as
                           the value of another field entered by the user or the user's role.
                           For example, the correctly formatted local postal address for customer
                           service inquiries differs based on locale. A postal address key flexfield
                           could display different segments and prompts for different users based
                           on a location condition in your application data, such as the user's
                           role or a value entered by the user.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Each structure can have one or more segments. Thus
                           a segment is a child of a structure. To store a particular segment,
                           such as Cost Center, in two different structures, you must define
                           the segment separately in each structure. Each structure may have
                           one or more structure instances. Each instance of a structure shares
                           the same number and order of segments, but differs in the values or
                           value sets used in validating the segments.

                           is validated. You define a structure instance for each key flexfield

                        <p>For example, each part number is a single combination,
                           such as PAD-YEL-11x14 or 01-COM-876-7BG-LTN. In these combinations,
                           the hyphen is the segment separator. If you have ten parts, define
                           ten combinations. A valid combination is an existing or new combination
                           that can be used because it's currently active and doesn't violate
                           cross-validation or security rules. A combination has different segments
                           depending on the flexfield structure being used for that combination.
                           Any combination is associated with only one particular flexfield structure. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Many applications refer to a key flexfield combination
                           by using the name of the entity or the key flexfield itself. For example,
                           Assets uses the asset key flexfield and refers to one of its combinations
                           as an asset key or asset key flexfield. In another example, Oracle
                           Fusion General Ledger refers to combinations of the accounting flexfield as
                           account or GL account. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Each key flexfield has one corresponding table, known
                           as the combinations table, where the flexfield stores a list of the
                           complete codes, with one column for each segment of the code, together
                           with the corresponding unique ID number (an account combination ID)
                           for that code. Then, other tables in the application have a column
                           that stores just the unique ID for the code. For example, you may
                           have a part number code, such as PAD-YEL-11x14. The Parts combinations
                           table stores that code along with its ID, 57494. If your application
                           lets you take orders for parts, you might then have an Orders table
                           that stores orders for parts. That Orders table would contain a single
                           column that contains the part ID, 57494, instead of several columns
                           for the complete code PAD-YEL-11x14. Typically, one combinations page
                           maintains the key flexfield, where the key flexfield is the representation
                           of an entity in your application. Maintain individual combinations,
                           such as part numbers in the combinations page.

                        <p>If your key flexfield or certain usages or references
                           of the key flexfield don't permit dynamic combination creation, you
                           may control whether dynamic combination creation is enabled for each
                           structure instance. If enabled, a user can enter a new combination
                           of segment values using the flexfield window from a foreign key page.
                           For example, when entering a transaction, a GL user can enter a new
                           expense account combination for an account that doesn't yet exist.
                           Your application creates the new account by inserting the new combination
                           into the combinations table behind the scenes. Assuming that the new
                           combination satisfies any existing cross-validation rules, the flexfield
                           inserts the new combination into the combinations table, even though
                           the combinations table isn't the underlying table for the foreign
                           key page.

                           provides more room for changes than 100 available values for a 2-character

                           and allow for future needs. Don't change the number, order, and maximum
                           length of segments once you have acquired flexfield data.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Structure Delimiters</h4>
                        
                        <p>A delimiter separates the segments when they appear
                           to end users. The delimiter value of a structure specifies the character
                           used to visually separate segment values when the key flexfield is
                           displayed as a string of concatenated segments in the UI.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Choose the delimiter value of your key flexfield carefully
                           so that it doesn't conflict with the flexfield data. For example,
                           if your data frequently contains periods, such as in monetary or numeric
                           values, don't use a period as your segment  separator. Any character
                           you expect to appear frequently in your segment values or descriptions
                           isn't a good choice for the delimiter. If you change the configuration
                           of a key flexfield, such as the delimiter, the change affects the
                           previously stored key flexfields with that structure.

                        <p>Within key flexfields, value set security applies
                           to the selection of the individual segment values in the segment list

                           have access to. Applications development controls whether or not value
                           set security rules propagate to the foreign key table. By default

                        <p>A page with a foreign key reference has a base table
                           or view that contains a foreign key reference to a combinations table
                           with the actual flexfield segment columns. This lets you manipulate
                           rows containing code combination IDs (CCID). 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A page with partial usage of a key flexfield presents
                           segments that are defined on a product's transactional table in addition
                           to being defined on a combinations table. In the case of a partial
                           usage page, it is possible that only part of the configuration is
                           visible. This enables the key flexfield to behave more like a descriptive flexfield. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A code combination maintenance page or combinations
                           page presents the combinations table. This enables directly creating
                           and maintaining code combinations. The combinations table contains
                           all key flexfield segment columns and a unique ID column. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A typical application has only one combinations page.
                           An application might not have a combinations page if it doesn't support
                           maintenance by administrators.

                        <p>A page containing a search region enables end users
                           to select which attributes of the key flexfield view object to use
                           as criteria to search for flexfield metadata. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you can configure seven segments for
                           the Account key flexfield. In a foreign key reference page, end users
                           see the typical key flexfield picker with all seven segments where
                           they can search for combinations. In a partial usage page using the
                           same key flexfield, end users potentially could see only a single
                           segment such as the Cost Center labeled segment, or they might see
                           multiple segments but displayed as individual segments rather than
                           as a picker for choosing combinations.

                           indexing, add the column representing the segment to the database

                           entering cost center or account or both as search criteria. No search
                           is performed if a user doesn't enter at least one query required attribute

                        You can use cross-validation rules for any key flexfield
                        that has cross-validation enabled. See the documentation for your
                        key flexfield to determine if it supports cross validation.
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Cross-validation rules prevent the creation of combinations
                        with values that shouldn't coexist in the same combination. For example,
                        your company requires that all revenue accounts must have a specific
                        department. Therefore, account combinations that have revenue account
                        values, such as all values between 4000 and 5999, must have a corresponding
                        department value other than 000, which indicates no department is
                        specified. You can define cross-validation rules that disallow creation
                        of combinations with incompatible segments, such as 4100-000 or 5000-000.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Alternatively, suppose your accounting key flexfield
                        has an Organization segment with two possible values, 01 and 02. You
                        also have a Natural Account segment with many possible values, but
                        company policy requires that Organization 01 uses the natural account
                        values 001 to 499 and Organization 02 uses the natural account values
                        500 to 999. You can create cross-validation rules to ensure that users
                        cannot create a general ledger account with combinations of values
                        such as 02-342 or 01-750.

                           set up your key flexfield structure. Define cross-validation rules
                           before creating combinations and before combinations are used in transactions.

                           flexfield, the deployment process generates an additional set of flattened
                           business components for use in business intelligence. The flattened
                           business components include attributes for business intelligence-enabled
                           segment instances only.  
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you assigned a label to a segment, the flattened

                           with that label. If you didn't assign a label, the flattened components
                           include a discrete attribute for each BI-enabled segment instance
                           in each structure.

                        <p>You can simplify reporting by representing similar
                           segments as a single logical object in Business Intelligence. If you
                           assign a label to segments that serve the same purpose in different
                           structures, you can consolidate the segments into a single attribute.
                           This prevents duplication and the extra workload and complexity that
                           result from the flattening process. For example, an organization may
                           have more than one definition of its key accounting flexfield to support
                           different requirements for accounting reporting. A US Accounting Flexfield
                           structure may have a segment called Subaccount to track project expenditures.
                           The same type of information may be tracked in a UK accounting flexfield
                           structure with a segment called Project. Equalize these two segments
                           to create a single list of values for reporting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Non-labeled segments aren't equalized across context
                           values, so the flattened components include a separate attribute for
                           each segment for each structure. It may not be possible to equalize
                           similarly labeled segments if they have incompatible data types or
                           value set types.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Assign a label to a segment to map the corresponding
                           attribute in the flattened components to a logical object in Oracle
                           Business Intelligence.  Using labels to map segments to BI logical
                           objects minimizes the steps for importing the flexfield into Oracle
                           Business Intelligence. Assigning a label to a segment serves to equalize
                           the attribute across structures, as well as map the equalized attribute
                           to business intelligence.

                           segments or create labels for assignment, as needed. Specify a code,

                           field, enter the name of the logical object in Oracle Business Intelligence
                           to which the segment label should map during import.  Specifying the
                           BI logical object minimizes the steps for importing the flexfield
                           into Oracle Business Intelligence and helps to equalize context-sensitive
                           segments across structures.

                        <p>After you deploy a business intelligence-enabled
                           flexfield, import the flexfield changes into the Oracle Business Intelligence
                           repository to make use of the newly flattened business components
                           in business intelligence. Then propagate the flexfield object changes.
                           When you import the metadata into the Oracle Business Intelligence
                           repository, you must do so as the FUSION_APPS_BI_APPID user.

                           Intelligence repository in Oracle Cloud implementations, run the Import
                           Oracle Fusion Data Extensions for Transactional Business Intelligence
                           process. For additional information about import, refer to the Oracle

                           Intelligence repository, you see both <code>&lt;name&gt;_</code> and <code>&lt;name&gt;_c</code> attributes for each
                           segment, along with some other optional attributes. The <code>&lt;name&gt;_</code> attribute contains the value. The <code>&lt;name&gt;_c</code> attribute contains the code of
                           the value set that the value comes from, and is used for linking to
                           the value dimension. You must import both attributes.
