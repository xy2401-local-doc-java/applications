                  <p>All customizations and extensions to your
                     application must be done in a full test environment. Typically, this
                     environment contains one or more applications that will be moved to
                     a production environment after you complete and test all customizations
                     and extensions.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>While using tools such as Page Composer, you can
                     make application customizations in a sandbox. Sandboxes store customizations
                     in Extensible Markup Language  files in a separate Oracle Metadata
                     Services repository that's available only when you work in that particular
                     sandbox. You can make the changes in either of the following:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>A test-only sandbox (that is, the
                           code in the sandbox is for testing only, and is never deployed)
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>A sandbox that's then published
                           to the full test environment
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Developers using design time tools, such as Oracle
                     JDeveloper, can deploy their customizations directly to that environment,
                     or they can publish to a sandbox. For more information on design time
                     customization workflow, see the Oracle Fusion Applications Extensibility
                     Guide for Developers.

                     Design time customizations aren't available in Oracle

                     For on-premise implementations, developers
                     may allow users, having access to the Setup and Maintenance work area,
                     to configure the customizations and extensions made to the application.

                     <h3>Run Time Customization Workflow: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>While using Application Composer and Page
                        Composer to make run time customizations to your application, use sandboxes to save your
                        changes in a segregated environment. For example, before making customizations,
                        suppose you create a sandbox named <code>MySandbox</code>, and then make your customizations in that sandbox. Now, if others
                        want to see your customizations, they can use <code>MySandbox</code>.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <div class="infobox-note"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                        If you have multiple users working on the same sandbox,
                        then conflicts may arise within a sandbox. Hence, users must adhere
                        to the prescribed guidelines to avoid such conflicts.
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <p>You can also use a sandbox while defining security
                        policies for custom objects that you have created using Application
                        Composer. A security sandbox stores the security information in new
                        database tables that are available only when you choose to work in
                        that sandbox.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>After you complete your customizations, others can
                        review and approve your customizations, and then publish to the full
                        test environment.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p> Note that a flexfield sandbox is for testing only
                        and can't be published. Instead, you can deploy a flexfield to the
                        full test environment using the flexfield UI. To test a flexfield
                        configuration before deploying it to the full test environment, deploy
                        it to a flexfield sandbox. The changes that you deploy to a sandbox
                        are isolated from the full test environment. Users who make the flexfield
                        sandbox active in their session can only see these changes. After
                        you're satisfied with the changes in the sandbox, you can deploy the
                        changes to the full test environment.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can also use the Manage Customizations dialog
                        box to:
                     </p>

                              or task flow.

                     <p>You can view the customizations for a user under
                        the Current Context column on the Manage Customizations dialog box.
                        On this dialog box, you can change the page, page fragment, or task
                        flow for which you're viewing customizations using the <span class="uicontrol">Search</span> field.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Developers too may be assigned to specific roles
                        and can view only those customizations that are permitted for the
                        specific roles. However, administrators can view all customizations
                        made at the site level, and for any user, under the All Layers column
                        on the Manage Customizations page. To view customizations made by
                        more than one user, administrators can select multiple users.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Sometimes, an administrator may need to view a personalization
                        that was made by another end user. For example, suppose a user made
                        an error while personalizing a page and that page is no longer displayed
                        for the user. Because the user can't open the page, the user can't
                        correct the error. In this case, the administrator can access the
                        page, request to see the user's changes, and delete those changes
                        to restore the page to its original settings.
                     </p>

                        <p>To diagnose customization issues, determine
                           whether customizations have been applied to a page. Use the Manage
                           Customizations dialog box to determine if page-level customizations
                           exist. If a page customization causes problems, such as a user interface
                           component disappears from a page, you can export the customizations
                           and examine the document file.

                     <p>You can apply different types of customizations
                        to an application. For example, you can apply changes to an application's

                        to data security of the application. All such customizations are stored in sandboxes and are validated
                        before applying them to an application.

                                 business components - These changes are captured in a flexfield that's
                                 deployed as a single flexfield sandbox.

                           in the mainline metadata, either publish the metadata or data security sandbox, or deploy
                           the flexfield. You can download only metadata and data security sandboxes
                           as a sandbox file for import to another application instance.

                        <p>To customize your application
                           in run time, you must first create a sandbox and then use tools, such
                           as Page Composer to make the customizations. These changes remain
                           within the sandbox and don't affect the mainline metadata. You can
                           test and validate the changes by publishing the sandbox to a full
                           test environment. After testing the application, you can move to the
                           production environment. The customizations created in the sandbox
                           will be migrated to the production environment and will be available
                           to the users.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Don't make customizations directly in the mainline
                           metadata. Make all customizations first in the sandbox. When you make
                           changes to an application at run time in a sandbox, you isolate the
                           changes from the mainline metadata. After completing the changes in
                           the sandbox, verify them. When you're ready to save the changes, publish
                           the metadata or security-enabled sandbox to the mainline metadata.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you create a sandbox, you can only see the customization
                           information of the existing customizations in the current mainline
                           metadata. For example, suppose you do customization in a sandbox and
                           publish it. Then, on creating another sandbox for the next customization,
                           you will see customization1 in the new sandbox because customization1
                           exists in the current mainline metadata.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Flexfield sandboxes are for testing only and can't
                           be published. Make flexfield configurations that are stored in a database.
                           Then, deploy those configurations to a sandbox to see the resulting
                           deployment artifacts in a sandbox environment. Flexfields are deployed
                           directly to the mainline metadata using the flexfield user interface.

                        <p>You can use several run time tools to customize the
                           application. For example, you can customize objects and pages using
                           Page Composer, which uses sandbox manager. Oracle Business Process
                           Composer and Oracle SOA Composer are also run time customization tools,
                           but they don't use sandbox manager. They have their own mechanisms
                           for handling customization changes.

                        <p>Metadata sandboxes that you create using sandbox
                           manager are available in Oracle JDeveloper while creating and deploying
                           customizations for a deployed application in Oracle WebLogic Server.
                           During deployment, the available sandboxes (except security sandboxes)
                           appear in a selection list in Oracle JDeveloper. Oracle JDeveloper
                           is not available in Oracle Cloud implementations. You can save, download,
                           and import the metadata sandbox sessions as files into other applications.

                        <p>To create a flexfield-enabled sandbox, deploy one
                           flexfield to a sandbox using the Manage Flexfield task flow. The flexfield
                           sandbox gets its name from the flexfield you deploy. You can't test
                           two flexfields in the same sandbox. After deploying a flexfield as
                           a sandbox, sign out and sign in again to view how the sandbox run
                           time reflects the flexfield changes, such as new segments. You can
                           redeploy the same flexfield to the same sandbox repeatedly as you
                           make incremental changes to the flexfield setup. A flexfield sandbox
                           can't be published. So, when the flexfield is deployed to the mainline
                           metadata, any page customizations or data security in the flexfield
                           sandbox can't reach the mainline metadata. If you're entitled to do
                           so, manage flexfield-enabled sandboxes in the Sandbox Manager.

                     <p>In the customization run time workflow, use sandboxes to isolate the
                        changes from the mainline
                        metadata for testing and validating. After you're satisfied
                        with the changes, you can publish the changes back to the mainline
                        metadata.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can create two types of sandboxes:</p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Sandboxes that are intended for
                              testing purposes only
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Sandboxes that are intended to
                              be published
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>The testing sandboxes are never published and therefore
                        produce no concurrency conflicts between sandboxes. You can have several
                        testing sandboxes at the same time. But if you have multiple users
                        working on the same testing sandbox, then they must adhere to the
                        prescribed guidelines.

                     <p>Customizations in the sandboxes that are published
                        are merged back to the mainline metadata. The following figure illustrates
                        the two types of sandboxes and their relationship to the mainline
                        metadata.

                           to customize the same artifact or perform customization tasks that
                           indirectly affect other shared files. For example:

                                 the same time. This conflict occurs in the metadata file that tracks
                                 which new objects both users created while saving their changes.
                              </p>

                           artifact, such as when a user performs an operation that adds or edits
                           a translatable string. For example, say:

                                 another user performs an operation at the same time that similarly
                                 affects translatable strings.

                           to avoid conflicts:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Multiple concurrent users in the
                                 same sandbox must operate only on different and unrelated objects.
                                 For example, if user1 updates object1, then user2 can update object2,
                                 but must not update object1. Suppose both modifications involve changes
                                 to translatable strings, and the users save changes to separate objects
                                 at the same time. Even then, a conflict can occur in the resource
                                 bundle that stores the translatable strings.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>If multiple users update the same

                                 concurrently, then they'll get a concurrent update error. The second
                                 user's updates won't be saved (the Save button will be disabled),

                        <p>Multiple sandboxes are used when customizations
                           are stored in testing as well as production sandboxes. Say, after
                           you create a sandbox, a concurrent change is made in the mainline
                           metadata. Now, when you attempt to publish that sandbox, the application
                           detects such conflicts at publication time, and you get error messages.

                           When you publish your sandbox, you may get a message
                           showing a conflict on oracle/apps/menu/fnd/applcore/dataSecurity/dataSecurityService/mds/DSMO.xml. This message indicates that the security changes that you made
                           in your sandbox conflict with other security changes in the mainline
                           metadata. Delete the sandbox and recreate your changes in a new sandbox.

                        <p>If multiple users are permitted to work in multiple
                           sandboxes at the same time, follow these guidelines to avoid conflicts:
                        </p>

                              <p>Any number of test-only sandboxes
                                 can operate concurrently. That is, multiple users can use multiple
                                 sandboxes concurrently for testing if these sandboxes will never be
                                 published. Sandboxes that are used for testing only, and that aren't
                                 published, cause no conflicts with each other. Be aware, however,
                                 that all modifications will be lost when the sandboxes are destroyed.

                              <p>For sandboxes that aren't for test-only
                                 and will be published, users can use multiple concurrent sandboxes
                                 only if they operate on mutually exclusive artifacts. For example,
                                 you can have:
                              </p>

                                 <li>
                                    <p>One sandbox that contains a page
                                       that a user is customizing to add a task flow
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Another sandbox that contains a
                                       different page from a different application
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                              </ul>
                              
                              <p>However, some objects might still share underlying
                                 artifacts, and thus it's not always obvious if two objects are truly
                                 mutually exclusive. Thus, proceed with caution when using multiple
                                 concurrent sandboxes that will be published. It's still possible that
                                 a conflict could occur, which would require the deletion of one or
                                 more sandboxes.

                                 in both, the mainline metadata and in one sandbox, or in two different
                                 sandboxes. Now, when you publish the sandbox, the application detects
                                 such conflicts and you get an error message. At this point, cancel
                                 publishing the sandbox to avoid overwriting previous changes.

                     <p>To make customizations to the application
                        artifacts, you need to first store them in an active sandbox. You can either create a sandbox
                        or select an existing sandbox, and designate it as an active sandbox.
                        The active sandbox holds the context for all the changes. The sandbox
                        uses a database to store the actual changes. After testing your changes,
                        you can publish the sandbox, or deploy the flexfield, and the changes
                        are merged into the mainline
                        metadata. Eventually, the sandbox is archived.

                     <p>The following procedure is for setting up non-flexfield
                        sandboxes. For flexfields, use the Manage Descriptive Flexfields task
                        or the Manage Extensible Flexfields task.

                                 in a sandbox. The customization set doesn't include customizations
                                 from a sandbox until the sandbox is published.

                        <p>You can use the Customization Migration page to move
                           customizations and extensions from any source environment to any target
                           environment. However, you must always perform your customizations
                           and extensions in a full test environment. Then use the Customization
                           Migration page to move these changes to a production environment.
                           As customization set migration doesn't provide a merge capability,
                           never customize or extend a production environment. When you import
                           a customization set, the rows in the database that are not preconfigured
                           are updated if a matching record exists. Otherwise a record is inserted.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The customization set doesn't include all deletions.
                           For example, the set does not include the removal of a customization
                           document using the Manage Customizations dialog box. After you import
                           a customization set into the target environment, you must examine
                           the environment for any deletions that you must make manually. Similarly,
                           the customization set does not include roles or role hierarchy changes.
                           Changes made to Security Console have to be manually updated in the
                           target environment.

                        CRM, and BI using the Outgoing tab of the Customization Migration

                                       In the target environment this field has values, Yes and No. After
                                       the import, the Status field in the target environment has values,

                                       data security privileges aren't automatically revoked in the target
                                       environment. For example, say a specific privilege is granted in the
                                       target environment, but the corresponding privilege doesn't exist
                                       in the source environment. During import, the privilege in the target
                                       environment won't be automatically revoked. To address this issue
                                       manually, add such a privilege to the source environment and revoke
                                       it. The revoke action is picked up as a customization instance during
                                       the customization import process and applied to the target environment.
