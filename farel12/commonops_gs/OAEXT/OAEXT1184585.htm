                     <p>You can customize and extend many aspects
                        of the application, for example the user interface, business intelligence,
                        and data model.

                     <p>The application is built using a common data model.
                        So, when you make a customization in one area, that customization
                        is available to all objects in the application. For example, if you
                        add an attribute to an object, you can easily add that attribute to
                        the:
                     </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Web-based view page</p>
                        </li>

                     <p>Generally, you use the same tools and processes to
                        customize all applications. For more information on customizing business
                        intelligence, see the Creating and Editing Analytics and Reports guides

                           Oracle Sales Cloud products, support using flexfields to extend the object with
                           custom attributes. Use a flexfield to create custom attributes without
                           programming. The flexfield captures data that is related to a specific
                           purpose, such as information about job positions or inventory items.
                           Each attribute is a segment of the flexfield, and corresponds to a
                           reserved column in the application database.

                           is the tip layer. An object may be customized more than once, but
                           in different layers. At run time, the tip-layer customizations take

                           use Page Composer to add a region on a page. A user personalizes the
                           same page to hide the region. In such a case, the user-layer customization

                           page. An XML file, noting the changes that the user made, is stored
                           in the repository. When User 1 signs in, the customization engine

                        <p>No matter what you see while customizing, the customizations
                           you make apply only to the edit layer, Job Role. For example, say
                           a field is hidden in the Site layer but displayed in the Territory
                           layer for Southwest. No customization exists for the field in the
                           Job Role layer for sales representative. Since Territory is higher
                           than Site, you see the field displayed while customizing in Page Composer.
                           However, suppose you choose to hide the field as part of your customization.
                           So, that customization applies to the Job Role layer for sales representatives.
                           Users with other job roles in the Southwest territory may still see
                           the field. However, Job Role is higher than Territory. So, no sales
                           representatives in any territory can see the field, unless a layer
                           higher than Job Role applies to any of these users and has the field
                           displayed.

                  <p>The application is based on business process
                     models that map out business flows. When you customize and extend your application,
                     for example to add new pages, you can use these models to help you
                     plan. For diagrams of business process models, see Oracle Fusion Business

                     <p>The business flows are presented in a five-level
                        hierarchy: industry (L0), business process area (L1), business process
                        (L2), activity (L3), and tasks (L4).

                        <li>
                           <p>The hierarchy goes from a high-level,
                              conceptual view to a low-level, application-specific view.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>L1 through L3 are business-driven
                              and don't depend on any specific implementation in the application.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>L4 aligns with specific features
                              and functionality in the application.

                     <p>The application is organized around these hierarchy
                        levels and flows, which puts focus on the activities and tasks that
                        you must perform. Several aspects of the application are influenced
                        by, if not directly based on, the business process modeling levels.
                        For example, the navigation, user interface, and parts of security
                        are influenced by the business process modeling levels.
