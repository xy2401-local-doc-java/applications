                  <p>A department tree is a hierarchy of departments.
                     For each tree, you can define multiple versions. However, only one
                     version can be active on any date. This topic describes aspects of

                     <p>Department tree is unlike most other objects that
                        you can load using HCM Data Loader, as it doesn't support the integration-key
                        types. When you load department trees, you must supply the user-key
                        attributes.

                        or another department tree version. When the child is another department

                           <p>You must create the organization
                              tree and organization tree version to which the nodes belong. You
                              can either load them using HCM Data Loader or create them using the
                              Manage Organization Trees task in the Workforce Structures work area.

                              version. Simply adding an organization to the organization tree hierarchy
                              doesn't create the organization. Similarly, removing an organization
                              reference from an organization tree hierarchy doesn't delete the organization
                              record.

                     <p>The organization tree node records the relationship
                        between a parent organization and a child, which can be either an
                        organization or another organization tree version. When the child
                        is an organization, you specify its classification on the <span class="uicontrol">ClassificationCode</span> attribute. When the child
                        is another organization tree version, the organization nodes of that
                        version are included by reference. When you load organization tree
