                     <p>HCM Data Loader has a comprehensive user
                        interface for loading data, monitoring progress, and reviewing any
                        errors. It provides real-time information for all stages of its processing.
                        HCM Data Loader's user interface also includes detailed information
                        about the component hierarchies and attributes of supported business

                     <p>You can load data from either delimited data (.dat)
                        files or spreadsheets. You can load most supported business objects
                        using either method. You can generate business-object templates to
                        use as the basis of your own .dat files. For a selected business-object
                        component, the template includes every attribute, including those
                        for configured flexfields. When using spreadsheets, you define spreadsheet templates to suit
                        business needs and generate spreadsheets from those templates.

                  <p>You can implement Oracle HCM Cloud either
                     in full or in coexistence mode. In a coexistence implementation, you
                     use Oracle Fusion Talent Management or Oracle Fusion Compensation,
                     but continue to use your existing HR applications. For both full and coexistence implementations,
                     you implement Oracle HCM Cloud by performing the tasks that appear
                     in your implementation project or for selected functional areas. This
                     topic describes how HCM Data Loader supports these implementation
                     types.

                     <p>If you're performing a full implementation
                        of Oracle HCM Cloud, then you can use HCM Data Loader to bulk-load
                        any existing HCM data at appropriate stages in the implementation.
                        Typically, you load each type of data once only for this type of implementation.
                        Following successful upload, you manage your data in Oracle HCM Cloud.
                     </p>

                     <p>In a coexistence implementation, you use
                        Oracle Fusion Talent Management or Oracle Fusion Compensation, but
                        maintain your existing HR applications. For this type of implementation,
                        you:

                              Oracle HCM Cloud, which becomes the application of record for talent
                              data. 
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Upload other types of data, such
                              as person records, periodically to Oracle HCM Cloud. The source system
                              remains the application of record for this data.

                     <p>To implement an HCM coexistence scenario, for any
                        source system, you can use HCM Data Loader for data upload. Follow
                        the general instructions provided for HCM Data Loader. Oracle doesn't
                        supply tools to extract data from your source systems. Work with your
                        implementation partner or develop your own process for extracting
                        the source data.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>HCM Data Loader provides a Compensation Changes extract.
                        You can extract assignment, bonus, and salary changes for a specified compensation run if you're
                        using Oracle Fusion Compensation in a coexistence scenario.

                        the associated record exists in Oracle HCM Cloud. Therefore, before
                        you attempt to load data that references foreign objects, you must
                        ensure that those foreign objects exist in Oracle HCM Cloud. For a
                        new implementation, you're recommended to load each business object
                        separately and ensure that it loads successfully before importing
                        the next. If you supply all business objects in the same .zip file,
                        then HCM Data Loader loads them in order of dependency. In this case,
                        a reference to a foreign object fails only if the referenced object
                        failed to load.

                        They're always required when you create a logical object, regardless

                     <p>You can also use user keys when updating logical
                        objects. However, the value of a user key can change, and some user-key
                        attributes are translatable. For this reason, you can't update some
                        business objects if you supply only user keys to reference them. Therefore,
                        whenever possible, you're recommended to use source keys when updating
                        objects.

                     (GUIDs) and surrogate IDs are two of the four types of keys that HCM
                     Data Loader supports. This topic describes when you can use GUIDs
                     and surrogate IDs to identify business objects uniquely.

                     <p>When you create an integration-enabled business object
                        in Oracle HCM Cloud, a GUID is generated for the object automatically.
                        As the GUID is generated when you create the business object, it's
                        suitable only for identifying business objects that already exist.
                        You can't supply a GUID when creating a business object. The GUID,
                        a hexadecimal value, isn't held on the created object but exists in
                        the Integration Key Map table.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>GUIDs are useful when you share changes with down-stream
                        applications, such as third-party payroll providers. You extract the
                        changes for the third-party payroll and provide the GUID as the unique
                        key to the worker. When reporting any updates back to Oracle HCM Cloud,
                        you can use GUIDs to identify the records to update.
                     </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Oracle Fusion Surrogate IDs</h3>
                     
                     <p>The surrogate ID, a numeric value, is the internal
                        system identifier that's generated when you create a business object.
                        All objects, including those that aren't integration-enabled, have
                        surrogate IDs. The surrogate ID is held on the object. The ID is also
                        used in the Integration Key Map table to provide a mapping for GUID
                        and source-key values. As the surrogate ID isn't generated until the
                        object is created, you can't use this value when creating objects.
                        Access to surrogate IDs may also be limited. On-premises customers
                        are more likely to have access to surrogate IDs than Oracle HCM Cloud
                        customers.

                  <p>Each Oracle HCM Cloud business object is
                     a hierarchy of business-object components. At the top of the hierarchy
                     is the parent component, and beneath it may be child and grandchild
                     components. Each business-object component has multiple attributes.

                  <p>For example, the rating model business object includes
                     rating model, rating level, and rating category components. The rating
                     model component is the parent of the other two components. Each component
                     has attributes such as rating model name, rating model code, rating
                     level code, and so on.

                     Data Loader is the worker object, where five levels exist in the object

                     work measure, assignment manager, assignment grade steps, and assignment

                     <p>When you deliver multiple components for the same

                        If any component of the logical object fails validation, then the
                        whole logical object is rejected. As HCM Data Loader loads only complete
                        logical objects, you can be sure of exactly which data has been loaded.
                        For example, when loading jobs, you know which jobs loaded successfully and which jobs failed to
                        load.
