      <meta name="description" content="The worker business object includes all information related to a person and his or her work relationships. This topic describes
      some general considerations that apply when you load workers. Select the worker object on the Initiate Data Load page to review
      its component hierarchy: You can't update most components of the worker hierarchy if you supply only a user key. This restriction
      exists because the attribute that you want to change is the attribute that's used to identify the record. For example, in
      the Person Address component, the AddressLine1 attribute is used both to identify the address to update and to supply the
      new value. Therefore, you're recommended always to supply source keys when creating workers and use them when updating worker
      records. A person can have multiple instances of some components, such as addresses, phones, and e-mails. When you load multiple
      instances of a component for a person, you must: You must understand the employment model in the legal employer to which you're
      loading work relationships and assignments. In general, the employment model can be three-tier, which supports employment
      terms, or two-tier, which doesn't. In any legal employer, the Employment Model option can be set to one of these values: Many
      components of the worker object include values, such as person type and assignment status, that must exist in the target environment.
      Perform the tasks shown in this table to define relevant values before you load data: You terminate work relationships, not
      workers. When you terminate a work relationship using HCM Data Loader, its child components, such as assignments, are terminated
      automatically. Don't try to terminate other child components of the worker object, such as person name. The person record
      must continue to exist and be returned in search results, for example. For examples of .dat files showing how to load workers,
      see HCM Data Loader: Loading Workers (document ID 2022624.1) on My Oracle Support at https://support.oracle.com. You must
      include any formatting characters in the value that you specify on the NationalIdentifierNumber attribute of the Person National
      Identifier component. For example, to load the US social security number 987-65-4322, you must include the hyphens. Don't
      specify the number as 987654322. If you omit the formatting, which is country-specific, then duplicate person records aren't
      found when the checking is based on national identifier."><script>window.ohcglobal || document.write('<script src="/en/dcommon/js/global.js">\x3C/script>')</script></head>

                        such as person name. The person record must continue to exist and
                        be returned in search results, for example.

                  <p>The worker object hierarchy is complex, with
                     many components and hierarchy levels. When you create workers, especially
                     in large volumes, you're recommended to load only the required components
                     initially. Once the worker objects exist, you can load related objects,
                     such as salary and element entries. This topic identifies the components that
                     you must load when you create workers and those that you must load
                     in some circumstances. You can load optional worker components once
                     the worker objects exist.

                        you create them. Once a worker exists, you use the user object and

                  <p>Many components of the worker object are
                     date effective. When creating workers, you must ensure that the effective
                     dates of individual worker components don't conflict. This topic suggests
                     an approach to setting the earliest effective start date and
                     last effective
                     end date for each date-effective component. You don't have
                     to follow this guidance. However, you must ensure that effective dates
                     are aligned for the complete worker object.

                  <p>When you load person records using HCM Data
                     Loader, you can request a check for duplicate records. In this case,
                     an error message is raised if you try to load a duplicate record.
                     This topic describes how to request duplicate checking for individual
                     person records. It also describes how this option works in conjunction
                     with the enterprise setting for duplicate checking.

                     <p>To request duplicate checking for a person record,
                        you include the <span class="uicontrol">PersonDuplicateCheck</span> attribute of the worker object. This attribute can have one of the
                        values shown in this table. The Description column identifies the
                        attributes that the application uses in each case to identify duplicate
                        records.

                     of work relationships, has a unique person
                     number. Person numbers can be either generated automatically

                     This topic describes ways of providing person numbers for uploaded

                        you must supply a source key to identify the person record uniquely.

                        using the <span class="uicontrol">PersonId(SourceSystemId)</span> attribute and hint.

                        that he or she loses the same day. If you replace the badge identifier
                        on the same day, then the time stamps differentiate the external identifiers.

                     <p>Person names are always created with both a global
                        and a local version. The name is created based on the name type that
                        you supply, and the other name is derived automatically. For example,
                        if you set the <span class="uicontrol">NameType</span> attribute
                        to <span class="uicontrol">GLOBAL</span>, then the local name is derived.
                        Alternatively, if you set <span class="uicontrol">NameType</span> to <span class="uicontrol">FR</span>, for example, then the global name is derived.
                        Typically, only the global name is required and the application copies
                        it to the local name automatically. However, if the person's name
                        must be held in two different character sets, then supply the local
                        name.

                     <p>A core name field may not be available for a legislation.
                        For example, Last Name Kanji isn't available for the Japanese legislation.
                        In this case, the data is stored in one of the <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation1</span> through <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation14</span> attributes. <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation1</span> through <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation14</span> are
                        reserved for this purpose. The person name styles table stores the
                        mapping of the name style to the name attributes. The name style is
                        the same for both the global and local-name records.

                        use one of the <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation15</span> through <span class="uicontrol">NameInformation30</span> attributes.

                        the image file is 2 GB. However, you're recommended to store images

                     transfers for both primary and nonprimary work relationships using
                     HCM Data Loader. A global transfer is a permanent transfer from one legal employer to
                     another. It results in the termination of an existing work relationship and the creation of a new one. The termination date of the existing
                     work relationship is one day prior to the start date of the new work
                     relationship.

                     <p>By default, the global transfer is applied to the

                        load the new work relationship with all its child components. The
                        new work relationship must have:

                        if the worker has two active work relationships, you can't perform
                        the global transfer on the primary one. You must make the primary
                        work relationship nonprimary before you attempt the global transfer.

                  <p>The full-time equivalent (FTE) value is the
                     result of dividing assignment working hours by standard working hours, which are typically those
                     of a full-time worker. For example, if the assignment working hours
                     are 10 and the standard working hours are 40, then the FTE value is
                     0.25. When you edit assignment working hours in the user interface,
                     FTE is calculated automatically. When you load assignment records
                     using HCM Data Loader, you can specify FTE values on the Assignment
                     Work Measure component. Alternatively, you can request that FTE values
                     be calculated automatically. This topic describes how to request automatic
                     calculation of FTE values.

                        in the value that you specify on the <span class="uicontrol">NationalIdentifierNumber</span> attribute of the Person National Identifier component. For example,
                        to load the US social security number <span class="uicontrol">987-65-4322</span>, you must include the hyphens. Don't specify the number as <span class="uicontrol">987654322</span>. If you omit the formatting, which
                        is country-specific, then duplicate person records aren't found when
                        the checking is based on national identifier.
