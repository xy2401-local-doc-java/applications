                        to showcase top interpersonal and specialized skills and display a

                        want to develop and engage with others to establish their expertise.

                     <p>A meeting survey is an automated survey sent
                        by managers to evaluate the skills of their direct reports. Host and
                        attendees select <span class="uicontrol">Opt-in to meeting surveys</span> in the <span class="uicontrol">Update Preferences</span> page
                        to participate in meeting surveys. Hosts include the e-mail account
                        of the meeting survey calendar and the attendee names in their meeting
                        invites. Attendees receive an e-mail with a link to the survey.

                     <p>The response is analyzed to determine the
                        sentiment expressed by the respondent. The words in the response are
                        used to determine if the overall sentiment is positive, negative,
                        or neutral. For example, "The audio quality was poor" is analyzed
                        as negative sentiment based on the use of the word 'poor'.
