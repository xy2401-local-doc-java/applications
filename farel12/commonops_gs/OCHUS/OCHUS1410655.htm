                        For example, a department may also have the legal employer classification.
                        An organization belongs to an organization security profile data instance set if it satisfies any one of the security profile's classification
                        criteria. For example, if you secure by department hierarchy only,
                        a department that's also a legal employer is included because it's
                        a department.

                        that the organization remains valid. No automatic validation of the

                        occur independently of the organization security profile.
