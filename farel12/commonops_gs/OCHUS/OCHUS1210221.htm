                  <p>Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher is
                     a set of tools for creating formatted reports based on data models.
                     You can access Business Intelligence Publisher from Business Intelligence
                     Composer or the Business Intelligence Catalog by clicking <span><span class="uicontrol">New</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Report</span></span>. This topic describes how you can use secured list

                  <p>Some reporting tools combine the data model, layout,
                     and translation in one report file. With that approach, business-intelligence
                     administrators must maintain multiple copies of the same report to
                     support minor changes. By contrast, Business Intelligence Publisher
                     separates the data model, layout, and translation. Therefore, reports
                     can be:

                  <p>A dimension is a collection of business attributes
                     or a hierarchy structure that you use to group or aggregate numeric
                     measures. All Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence dimensions
                     are unsecured, except for the Assignment Manager dimension. Therefore,
                     when you select a single dimension, such as the worker or department
                     dimension, you can see all worker and department data unfiltered.
                     Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence data security isn't applied
                     until you select more than one dimension or one dimension plus one
                     or more metrics.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>For example, if you select Department Name from the
                     Workforce Management - Worker Assignment Real Time subject area, then
                     you can view all departments. When you add Assignment Count to the
                     report, data security is applied and you can view workers only in
                     the departments that you can access.

                     <p>Assignment Manager is a hierarchical structure representing
                        the reporting relationship between workers and managers. This dimension
                        is the only secured HCM dimension in Oracle Transactional Business
                        Intelligence. The Assignment Manager hierarchy is restricted to line
                        managers. If the signed-in user doesn't have direct reports, then
                        he or she sees no data when you include Assignment Manager in the
                        report.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Reserve the use of Assignment Manager for line managers
                        only. Some other job roles, such as human resource analyst, may need
                        access to manager information. In these cases, use the Manager Name
                        in the Worker dimension instead of the Assignment Manager hierarchy.

                     <h3>How can I give line managers access to talent management subject areas?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The predefined Line Manager role has no access
                        to talent management subject areas. To provide this access, create
                        a custom Line Manager role. Add relevant transaction analysis duty
                        roles to the custom role. For example, you may want to provide access
                        to Workforce Goals subject areas. In this case, add both the Goal
                        Management Transaction Analysis Duty and Goal Management Transaction
                        Analysis roles to your custom role.
