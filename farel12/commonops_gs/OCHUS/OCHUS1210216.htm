                  <p>User accounts for users of Oracle Fusion
                     Applications are maintained on your LDAP directory server. By default,
                     Oracle HCM Cloud sends some personal information about users to the
                     LDAP directory. This information includes the person number, person name, phone,
                     and manager of the person's primary assignment. HCM Cloud shares these
                     details to ensure that user-account information matches the information
                     about users in HCM Cloud.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>This topic describes how and when you can send personal
                     information explicitly to your LDAP directory.

                     <p>After loading person records using HCM Data Loader,
                        for example, you run the process Send Pending LDAP Requests. This
                        process sends bulk requests for user accounts to the LDAP directory.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>When you load person records in bulk, the order in
                        which they're created in HCM Cloud is undefined. Therefore, a person's
                        record may exist before the record for his or her manager. In such
                        cases, the Send Pending LDAP Requests process includes no manager
                        details for the person in the user-account request. The LDAP directory
                        information therefore differs from the information that HCM Cloud
                        holds for the person. To correct any differences between these versions
                        of personal details, you run the Send Personal Data for Multiple Users
                        to LDAP process.

                  <p>By default, user accounts are suspended automatically
                     when a user has no roles. This automatic suspension of user accounts is controlled by the <span class="uicontrol">User Account Maintenance</span> enterprise option.
                     Human resource (HR) specialists can also suspend a user account manually,
                     if necessary. This topic describes how automatic account suspension
                     and reactivation occur. It also explains how to suspend a user account
