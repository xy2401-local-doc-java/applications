                        with a data scope (country). You define the data scope of a data role
                        in one or more HCM security profiles. HCM data roles aren't part of the security
                        reference implementation. You define all HCM data roles locally
                        and assign them directly to users.

                     <p>Abstract roles represent a worker's role in the enterprise independently
                        of the job that you hire the worker to do. Three abstract roles are
                        predefined in Oracle HCM Cloud:
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Employee</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Contingent Worker</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Line Manager</p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>You can also create custom abstract roles. All workers
                        are likely to have at least one abstract role. Their abstract roles
                        enable users to access standard functions, such as managing their
                        own information and searching the worker directory. You assign abstract
                        roles directly to users.
                     </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Job Roles</h3>
                     
                     <p>Job roles represent the job that you hire a worker
                        to perform. Human Resource Analyst and Payroll Manager are examples
                        of predefined job roles. You can also create custom job roles. Typically,
                        you include job roles in data roles and assign those data roles to
                        users. The IT Security Manager and Application Implementation Consultant
                        predefined job roles are exceptions to this general rule because they're
                        not considered HCM job roles. Also, you don't define their data scope
                        in HCM security profiles.

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Aggregate Privileges</h3>
                     
                     <p>Aggregate privileges combine the functional privilege
                        for an individual task or duty with the relevant data security policies.
                        The functional privileges that aggregate privileges provide may grant
                        access to task flows, application pages, work areas, reports, batch programs,
                        and so on. Job and abstract roles inherit aggregate privileges directly.
                        Aggregate privileges don't inherit other roles. All aggregate privileges
                        are predefined and you can't edit them. Although you can't create
                        custom aggregate privileges, you can include the predefined aggregate
                        privileges in custom job and abstract roles. You don't assign aggregate
                        privileges directly to users.

                     <p>Each predefined duty role represents a logical grouping
                        of privileges that you may want to copy and edit. Duty roles differ
                        from aggregate privileges as follows:
                     </p>

                           <p>They can inherit aggregate privileges
                              and other duty roles.

                     <p>Job and abstract roles may inherit duty roles either
                        directly or indirectly. You can include predefined and custom duty
                        roles in custom job and abstract roles. You don't assign duty roles
                        directly to users.

                  <p>Aggregate privileges are a type of role.
                     Each aggregate privilege combines a single function security privilege
                     with related data security policies. All aggregate privileges are
                     predefined. This topic describes how aggregate privileges are named
                     and used.

                     <p>An aggregate privilege takes its name from the function
                        security privilege that it includes. For example, the Promote Worker
                        aggregate privilege includes the Promote Worker function security

                        directly. Duty roles may also inherit aggregate privileges. However,
                        aggregate privileges can't inherit other roles of any type. As most

                     <p>You can include aggregate privileges in the role
                        hierarchy of a custom role. Treat aggregate privileges as role building

                     <p>You can't create, edit, or copy aggregate privileges,
                        nor can you grant the privileges from an aggregate privilege to another
                        role. The purpose of an aggregate privilege is to grant a function
                        security privilege only in combination with a specific data security
                        policy. Therefore, you must use the aggregate privilege as a single
                        entity.

                        role's aggregate privileges are never copied. Instead, role membership
                        is added automatically to the aggregate privilege for the copied role.

                  <p>If the predefined security reference
                     implementation doesn't fully represent your enterprise, then you can make changes.
                     For example, the predefined Line Manager abstract role includes compensation
                     management privileges. If some of your line managers don't handle
                     compensation, then you can create a custom line manager role without
                     those privileges. To create a custom role, you can either copy an
                     existing role or create a role from scratch.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>During implementation, you evaluate the predefined
                     roles and decide whether changes are needed. You can identify predefined
                     application roles easily by their role codes, which all have the prefix <span class="uicontrol">ORA_</span>. For example, the role code of the
                     Payroll Manager application job role is <span class="uicontrol">ORA_PAY_PAYROLL_MANAGER_JOB</span>. All predefined roles are granted many function security privileges
                     and data security policies. They also inherit aggregate privileges and  duty roles. To make
                     minor changes to a role, copying and editing the predefined role is
                     the more efficient approach. Creating roles from scratch is most successful
                     when the role has very few privileges and you can identify them easily.
