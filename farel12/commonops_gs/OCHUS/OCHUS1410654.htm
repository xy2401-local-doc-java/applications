                        the set of records that a user can access is calculated dynamically.
                        The calculation is based on the user's assigned areas of responsibility.
                        This approach has several advantages:

                        Scope of responsibility in a person security profile
                        can be any one of several values, such as department or payroll. For

                        that you can also select in a person security profile.
