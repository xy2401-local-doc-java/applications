                     To provision a role to users, you define a relationship, called a

                     provisioning complete.

                     <p>You can provision data roles, abstract roles, and job roles to users. However,
                        for Oracle HCM Cloud users, you typically include job roles in HCM
                        data roles and provision those data roles.

                        of their assignments satisfies the conditions in the relevant role mapping. Provisioning
                        occurs when you create or update worker assignments. For example,
                        when you promote a worker to a management position, the worker acquires
                        the line manager role automatically if an appropriate role mapping
                        exists. All changes to assignments cause review and update of a worker's
                        automatically provisioned roles.

                     <p>Automatic role provisioning and deprovisioning are
                        based on current data. For a future-dated transaction, such as a future

                        The Send Pending LDAP Requests process identifies future-dated transactions
                        and manages role provisioning and deprovisioning at the appropriate
                        time. These role-provisioning changes take effect on the system date.
                        Therefore, a delay of up to 24 hours may occur before users in other
                        time zones acquire their roles.

                           <p>Users with at least one assignment
                              that matches the conditions in a role mapping and who don't currently
                              have the associated roles acquire those roles.

                           <p>Users who currently have the roles
                              but no longer satisfy the associated role-mapping conditions lose
                              those roles.

                     <p>When a user has no roles, his or her user account
                        is also suspended automatically by default.

                     <p>The process creates requests immediately to add or
                        remove roles. When running the process, you can specify when role
                        requests are to be processed. You can either process them immediately
                        or defer them as a batch to the next run of the Send Pending LDAP
                        Requests process. Deferring the processing is better for performance,
                        especially when thousands of role requests may be generated. Set the <span class="uicontrol">Process Generated Role Requests</span> parameter
                        to <span class="uicontrol">No</span> to defer the processing.
                        If you process the requests immediately, then Autoprovision Roles
                        for All Users produces a report identifying the LDAP request ranges
                        that were generated. Requests are processed on their effective dates.

                     <p>You're recommended to run Autoprovision Roles for
                        All Users after creating or editing role mappings. You may also have
                        to run it after loading person records in bulk if you request user
                        accounts for those records. If an appropriate role mapping exists
                        before the load, then this process isn't necessary. Otherwise, you
                        must run it to provision roles to new users loaded in bulk. Avoid
                        running the process more than once in any day. Otherwise, the number
                        of role requests that the process generates may slow the provisioning
                        process.
