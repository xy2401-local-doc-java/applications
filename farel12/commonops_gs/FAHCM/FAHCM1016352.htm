                     <p>The Define Payroll task list in the Setup and Maintenance
                        work area contains most of the setup tasks required for payroll processing.
                        However, you must first create any additional geographies and enterprise
                        structures required for managing and reporting payroll information
                        as follows:
                     </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Use the Define Geographies for
                              HCM task list to verify predefined geographies and load any additionally
                              required local geographies.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Use the Define Legal Entities for
                              HCM task list to create a legislative data group for each country
                              you operate in. Also create at least one legal entity designated as
                              a payroll statutory unit for each legislative data group.
                           </p>

                              Units for HCM task list to create any additional tax reporting units
                              that you need.

                              HCM task lists to create charts of accounts, ledgers, and accounting
                              calendars. When you create a bank for a payment source, you must select
                              a legal entity that is assigned to a ledger for the associated legislative
                              data group. These financial components are also required for payroll
                              costing.

                        task list that was generated in the Setup and Maintenance work area;
                        however, in your task list the tasks may be interspersed with other
                        tasks that do not need to be performed before you can run a payroll.
                        Although the element template will create the formulas and balances
                        needed to process that earning or deduction, you may want to create
                        additional formulas or balances to customize your processing, therefore
                        these tasks are included.
