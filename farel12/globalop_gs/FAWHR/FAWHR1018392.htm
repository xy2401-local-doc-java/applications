                     <p>System-generated performance predictions can
                        help you to validate your own assessments of employees. Performance
                        predictions, in conjunction with voluntary-termination predictions,
                        enables you to avert the voluntary terminations that are the most

                        <p>Performance predictions are based on data from all
                           employees. The process that collects relevant data and generates the
                           predictions is Collect Data and Perform Data Mining for Predictive
                           Analytics, which uses Oracle Data Mining (ODM) and predicts voluntary
                           termination. You can manage predictive models using the Manage Predictive
                           Models task in the Setup and Maintenance work area.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can perform data collection either for the enterprise
                           or for a specified manager assignment. However, the data-mining stage of the process
                           is always performed on all of the latest available data.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The process has no default schedule. You are recommended
                           to run the process weekly if the volume of relevant transactions in
                           your enterprise (such as hires, terminations, and promotions) is high;
                           otherwise, run the process at least monthly. Schedule the process
                           at a time of low system activity to avoid performance impacts.
                        </p>

                              <p>The attributes of interest include those most likely
                                 to show a correlation with high performance. In some cases, simple
                                 values, such as manager name are required; in others, such as percentage
                                 increase in sickness leave, the process calculates the values. Most
                                 of these attributes are held at the assignment level; therefore, for
                                 work relationships with multiple assignments, multiple values are
                                 collected.

                                 ODM, which identifies patterns and relationships in the data and builds
                                 a model for predicting employee performance.

                              <p>ODM makes performance predictions
                                 for current employees according to the predictive model. For example,
                                 if performance is high in a particular job and grade, current employees
                                 with that job and grade may have a greater likelihood of high performance
                                 than workers in other jobs and grades.

                                 relates to an employee assignment. For employees with multiple assignments,
                                 multiple performance predictions are made (one for each assignment).
                                 If an employee reports to a single manager in multiple assignments,
                                 the manager sees multiple predictions for that employee.

                                 of employee assignments for which the factor is the main contributory

                     <p>People are often the enterprise's greatest asset, and their
                        loss can be expensive for many reasons. System predictions can make
                        you aware of potential issues and their likely causes so that you
                        can address them. For example, if an employee whose performance is
                        predicted to be high is also identified as likely to leave voluntarily,
                        you can consider changes to relevant factors, such as grade or location, to reduce the risk.
                        Voluntary predictions appear on the Manager Resources dashboard.

                        <p>Predictions of voluntary termination are based on
                           existing data from all work relationships. The process that collects relevant data
                           and generates the predictions is Collect Data and Perform Data Mining
                           for Predictive Analytics, which uses Oracle Data Mining (ODM) and
                           also predicts performance.

                           or for a specified manager assignment; however, the data-mining stage of the process
                           is always performed on all of the latest available data.

                              <p>For all employee work relationships, the process
                                 collects the values of a large set of attributes. The attributes include,
                                 for example, time in grade, current job, latest salary increase, performance rating, and number
                                 of sickness absences in the previous year. The attributes of interest
                                 include those most likely to show a correlation with voluntary termination.
                                 In some cases, simple values, such as manager name, are required;
                                 in others, such as percentage increase in sickness leave, the process
                                 calculates the values. Most of these attributes are held at the assignment
                                 level; therefore, for work relationships with multiple assignments,
                                 multiple values are collected.

                                 a predictive model that captures the differences between employees
                                 who have terminated voluntarily and all other employees.

                                 termination for current employees according to the predictive model.
                                 For example, if voluntary termination is high in a particular job
                                 and department, current employees with that job in that department
                                 may have a greater risk of voluntary termination than workers in other
                                 jobs or departments.
                              </p>
                              <p>Each prediction relates to
                                 an employee assignment. For employees with multiple assignments, multiple
                                 voluntary-termination predictions are made (one for each assignment).
                                 If an employee reports to a single manager in multiple assignments,
                                 the manager sees multiple predictions for that employee.

                           at highest risk of voluntary termination. The absolute risk of voluntary
                           termination for the high-risk group may still be low in percentage
                           terms, but relative to that for other groups of employees, the risk
                           is high.

                           rating in the relevant rating model. Once you have the numeric rating,
                           you can identify the associated rating level.

                     <p>You can use workforce modeling to create
                        or edit a model to terminate workers. You can use existing models
                        to terminate workers, and these models can also include other planned
                        updates, such as promotions and transfers. Any workers you terminate
                        will display as grey in the model. The terminations affect the analytics
                        which you can use to review the impact of your planned terminations.
                        The termination changes are only applied to the transactional system
                        when the model is approved.

                        the model. Therefore, Workforce Modeling runs a synchronization process
                        that checks the attributes in the live transactional system against
                        the attributes in the model, and makes some automatic updates, and
                        other recommendations. The synchronization process ensures the assignment
                        and vacancy information in Workforce Modeling are up to date with
                        any changes made in the live transactional system.

                           has been terminated, then the application synchronizes each attribute

                     <p>A person's readiness for promotion is based

                        in the same job and grade is 5 years, a promotion appears due if the
                        time since a person's last promotion is within range of 5 years. If
                        the gap is outside this range, the promotion appears as either not
                        due or overdue. Additional factors, such as performance and length
                        of service, determine whether you decide to promote a person whose
