                        Francisco in the US, for example). A temporary assignment is
                        a transfer for a limited term (temporary assignment in another department,
                        for example). To initiate a transfer or temporary assignment for a

                        and their status is changed to Suspended- Payroll Eligible by default.
                        You can override the default by deselecting the assignments that you
                        do not want to suspend; these assignments retain their original statuses.
                        You end the temporary assignment by selecting the End Temporary Assignment
                        action and specifying a return date. The suspended objects become
                        active as of the return date.

                     <p>A global transfer is the transfer of a person
                        to another legal employer (transfer of an employee from a UK subsidiary
                        to a US subsidiary, for example). A global temporary assignment is
                        the temporary transfer of a person to another legal employer (US employee
                        sent on a temporary assignment to the UK, for example). To initiate
                        a global transfer or temporary assignment for a person, select the
                        Manage Employment task in the Person Management work area, update
                        the assignment, and then select the relevant transfer action from
                        the Actions list.

                           relationship is terminated automatically using the default

                        <p>You can reverse a termination at any time provided
                           the same legal employer has not rehired the employee (or started a
                           new placement for a contingent worker). This is because a person cannot
                           have multiple employee or contingent worker relationships with the
                           same legal employer at the same time. For example, consider that an
                           employee was terminated on April 15, and the same legal employer rehired
                           the employee on May 1. You want to reverse the termination on May
                           15, but you cannot do so because this causes the employee to have
                           two concurrent work relationships with the same legal employer.

                           deferred processing and specify when to process the changes. The processing

                        <p>Sensitive transactions affect how concurrent transactions
                           are processed. You can't initiate a transaction for a person if there
                           is a concurrent
                           transaction pending approval for the same person. If, however,
                           the concurrent transaction is a sensitive termination, you can initiate
                           a transaction for the same person because the presence of a sensitive
                           transaction can't be disclosed. Enabling concurrent transactions can
                           create potential data conflicts. If the conflicts can't be resolved
                           automatically, the application routes the actions to a person with

                     <p>Suppose a line manager initiated a transfer for a
                        worker when a sensitive termination was pending approval for the same
                        person. The termination is now approved and applied to the database,
                        which may give rise to data conflicts. As the worker's HR Representative,
                        you must manually apply the required changes to resolve the following
                        data conflicts:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>The transfer is still pending approval
                              and the effective date of the transfer is later than or the same as
                              the termination date. In this case, the application automatically
                              rejects the transfer and notifies you.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>The transfer is still pending and
                              the effective date of the transfer is earlier than the termination
                              date. You receive a notification that you can withdraw the transfer
                              because the worker is already terminated. If you choose not to withdraw
                              the transfer, you receive a notification again (when the transfer
                              is applied) that you must reenter the transfer. You must reenter the
                              transfer so that the transfer details are reflected in the inactive
                              assignment created by the termination.

                           <p>The transfer is applied to the database
                              and the effective date of the transfer is later than or the same as
                              the termination date. The sensitive termination was hidden at the
                              time the transfer was initiated, however the transfer conflicts with
                              the termination. You receive a notification that you must delete the
                              transfer and reenter the termination. You must reenter the termination
                              because of data changes that occurred after the termination was initiated.

                           but defer processing until the termination date, because the person

                           termination to the person. Use the Deferred Processing option to postpone

                                 If the parent position doesn't have an incumbent either, the application
                                 checks for an incumbent one level up in the hierarchy or until it

                        <p>Termination notification date is the date
                           the initiator of the termination notifies the other party of the termination.
                           For example, a worker notifies an employer of his resignation or an
                           employer notifies a worker of an involuntary termination, such as
                           a layoff. The termination date is the worker's last date of employment;
                           this date defaults to the notification date plus the notice period
                           derived from the assignment. You can override this default when entering
                           the termination. You enter a termination using the Manage Work Relationship
                           task in the Person Management work area.

                           reports on 15th September, 2016. You reassign his direct reports with
                           an effective date of 15th September, 2016 on the Manage Direct Reports

                           incumbent in the parent position, the application checks one level
                           up in the hierarchy or until it finds an incumbent.

                           the manager type. For example, if the direct is a line report for
                           the current manager, you can reassign the direct only as a line report
                           to a new manager, but not as a direct of other type, such as a project
                           report or a mentee.

                     <p>You can add and reassign direct reports of
                        a manger's primary assignment when creating a global transfer or temporary assignment for the manager. Use the Manage Directs Reports page to reassign
                        direct reports in the secondary assignment before the global transfer
                        takes effect. You can add direct reports for the secondary assignment
                        when you create it. When you add or reassign direct reports, changes
                        occur at the assignment level for each report.

                     <p>You can select the same new manager for all the direct
                        reports or a different new manager for each report. When you select
                        reports for reassigning during global transfer or temporary assignment,
                        deselect any direct reports continuing to report to the transferring
                        manager in the new assignment. If you select any direct reports and
                        don't specify a new manager, they will continue to report to the current
                        manager in the inactive assignment.

                        <h4>What are worker and assignment category tags?</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>When you select a worker or assignment category
                           in the Job Details section of the Create Mass Assignment Change page,
                           you can see tags displayed next to the fields. These tags specify
                           the legislations associated with the selected category and have the
                           following meaning:
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Tags with + prefixes:  Indicate
                                 that the selected category only applies to the legislations with the
                                 + prefix. For example, Tags +FR,+IE,+NZ indicate that the selected
                                 category only applies to France, Ireland, and New Zealand.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Tags with - prefixes:  Indicate
                                 that the selected category applies to all legislations except the
                                 legislations with the - prefix. For example, Tags -FR,-IE,-BR indicate
                                 that the selected category applies to all legislations except France,
                                 Ireland, and Brazil.
                              </p>

                           <li>
                              <p>Tags with + and - prefixes:  If
                                 the tags contain a combination of + and - prefixes, the first prefix
                                 is considered and the rest is ignored. For example, Tags +FR,-IE,-BR
                                 indicate that the selected category only applies to France, Ireland,
                                 and Brazil.
                              </p>
