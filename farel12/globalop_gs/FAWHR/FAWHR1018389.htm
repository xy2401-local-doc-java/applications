                           For example, if a line manager searches for a language skill and a
                           match is found in the language-skills information of the manager's
                           direct or indirect reports, that information appears in the search

                           when the searcher is not a line manager. However, if the match is
                           found in public information, such as areas of expertise, it appears
                           in the search results for any user.

                           are copied from person records and organized in a keywords table for

                           is stored in the keywords table. Therefore, if you enter both a keyword
                           value and an effective as-of date, the search results may not be as
                           expected.

                        <p>This list also includes transactions routed to any
                           approval groups that you belong to, even though you may not have approved
                           the transactions. You can edit a pending transaction and perform the
                           same actions as those available in your worklist or notification summary.
                           You can approve, reject, or return a transaction to the previous approver.
                           Also, you can withdraw transactions that you have initiated. For example,
                           you may want to withdraw a new hire transaction after initiating it,
                           because of budget constraints.

                        <p> You can view transactions that you saved for later,
                           and transactions that aren't pending with you anymore, such as your
                           approved and rejected transactions. You can suspend transactions that
                           you have initiated or approved. For example, you may want to suspend
                           a new hire transaction that you have approved, until the hiring policy
                           changes are finalized. A suspended transaction remains inactive until
                           you resume the transaction. However, the ability to suspend transactions
                           is controlled by the workflow role BPMWorkflowSuspend. The suspend
                           and resume actions are available only to users having this role.

                        <p>No. Managers can't create checklist templates
                           which are available for allocation to all users. They can only create
                           specific checklists for their workers, and allocate existing checklist
                           templates to their workers, using the Manage Allocated Checklists
                           action in their portrait. Human Resource (HR) specialist users can
                           create both checklist templates and checklists for specific persons.
                           HR specialists can also save specific checklists as templates to make
                           them available for allocation to all users.

                        <p>No. Only task owners and performers can view
                           and update checklist tasks. You can, however, designate workers as
                           task owners or performers if you want workers to track the progress
                           of their tasks or perform the task actions.

                        <p>Each allocated checklist is a specific instance
                           of the checklist template. Therefore, changes in the checklist template
                           don't affect allocated checklists. Similarly, the checklist template
                           is unaffected by changes in allocated checklists.

                        <p>The allocated checklist contains the tasks
                           relevant to the person to whom the checklist is allocated; For example,
                           tasks associated with eligibility profiles appear in the allocated
                           checklist only if the person meets the eligibility criteria. During
                           allocation, performers are derived for the tasks based on the option
                           selected in the checklist template. Both task performers and owners
                           are notified of the assignment. They can access the checklist either
                           from the Recent Notifications Alert or from the My Tasks section in
                           their BPM worklist. They can optionally create a user view to filter
                           the tasks in their worklist. For example, task owners may create a
                           user view to only display those tasks that they own and not display
                           tasks for which they are performers.

                           performer can claim a task by accessing the notification. Once a performer
                           claims the task, the task assignment notification disappears from
                           the worklists of other performers.
