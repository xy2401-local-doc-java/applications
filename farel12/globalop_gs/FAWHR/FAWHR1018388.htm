                           a different primary relationship. This restriction exists because
                           a current worker or nonworker can't be without a primary work relationship
                           for any period of time.

                        that person's first work relationship. Once a person record exists, you can create
                        additional work relationships with the same or different legal employers.
                        The following scenarios describe some valid combinations of work relationships.
                        You create a person record in the New Person work area. You manage
                        work relationships in the Person Management work area.

                     <p>You select a worker type when you create a
                        new person record or work relationship. Because a person can have multiple work
                        relationships of multiple types simultaneously, a person can have
                        multiple worker types at once. You create a new person in the New
                        Person work area. You manage work relationships in the Person Management
                        work area.

                           Therefore, a predefined name style exists for many countries for capturing
                           relevant components of a person's name. The name style determines:

                              </p>
                              <p>For example, one country
                                 may display first name, last name, and title while another displays
                                 first name, middle name, and last name.

                              <p>For example, in one country

                        <p>When a country-specific name style doesn't exist,
                           a universal name style (last name, first name, title, and middle names)
                           is used.

                        <p>When you create a person record you select a legal employer, which
                           sets the legislative context for the record. For example, if the legal
                           employer is a Canadian legal entity, the legislative context is Canada
                           and the Canadian name style is used. A person's contacts have the

                        <p>A person can have multiple nonworker roles with a single legal
                           employer, all of which must belong to the same nonworker work relationship. For each nonworker role, you can create a separate nonworker assignment, and in each
                           nonworker assignment, you can select an appropriate nonworker person
                           type. For example, a nonworker could have three assignments with a
                           single legal employer, two as a paid volunteer, and one as a retiree.

                        <p>The structure of a person's name can vary among countries.
                           Therefore, a predefined name style exists for many countries for capturing
                           relevant components of a person's name. The name style determines:
                        </p>

                                 you create a person record.
                              </p>
                              <p>For example, one country
                                 may display first name, last name, and title while another displays
                                 first name, middle name, and last name.
                              </p>

                              </p>
                              <p>For example, in one country
                                 you may be required to enter a title while in another, the title may

                        <p>When a country-specific name style doesn't exist,
                           a universal name style (last name, first name, title, and middle names)
                           is used.

                        <p>When you create a person record you select a legal employer, which
                           sets the legislative context for the record. For example, if the legal
                           employer is a Canadian legal entity, the legislative context is Canada
                           and the Canadian name style is used. A person's contacts have the
                           same name style as the person for whom they are contacts.

                           is stored in the keywords table. Therefore, if you enter both a keyword
                           value and an effective as-of date, the search results may not be as
                           expected.

                        differences between items. Compare any person, job, and position items.
                        For example, you can compare a person with another person or with
                        a job profile. You can compare items in the Profiles work area and
                        on the talent review dashboard.

                           the items you select subsequently are secondary items. You can change
                           the comparison base if required. The comparison displays the base
                           item attributes, and indicates the differences between the attributes
                           of the secondary items and the base items. .

                           results. HR specialists

                           and the base job (2) as -1. The comparison doesn't display the difference
                           between the maximum values because the maximum competency requirement
                           of the secondary job (3) lies within the competency requirement of
                           the base job (between 2 and 4).

                           the new change is inserted in the object's history. Typically, you

                           start date is today's date; however, by setting an effective start
                           date that is earlier or later than the current date, you can insert
                           the new change at a different point, either to edit the object history
                           or to create a future-dated change. For example, you could change

                           start date of 1 January, 2011 because you were married on that date.

                           in Greek will see the Greek version of the person's name. If you use

                        <p>You can share personal information with both
                           internal recipients (people within the enterprise) and external recipients
                           (people outside the enterprise) who otherwise have no access to this
                           information. You share information using the Information Sharing task

                           details, payroll information, and user account details. A recipient's
                           access to the information doesn't expire, but you can revoke it.

                           a link to the shared information. Their access to this information
                           expires at a time that you specify.

                           The approval of the people whose information you're sharing is required.

                        <p>When you are transferring to a different legal
                           entity, the destination legal employer may not be able to initiate
                           your transfer because they do not have access to your records in the
                           source legal entity. Either you or the releasing line manager can
                           share your information with the receiving line manager or Human Resource
                           Specialist, enabling them to initiate the transfer. Similarly, you
                           can share selected information with external persons or organizations,
                           for a specific purpose, for example to complete a mortgage or loan
                           agreement. Use the Information Sharing action in your portrait to
                           share information.

                           are also accessible to external recipients. For example, if you share
                           your information with an external recipient on June 1 and the recipient
                           views it on June 5, they see the information effective as of June
                           5. If the worker was terminated on June 3, for example, no information
                           is available to the recipient.

                           that you select for sharing. Each external recipient receives an e-mail
                           with a link to the shared information. The information that you can
                           share externally is also limited.
