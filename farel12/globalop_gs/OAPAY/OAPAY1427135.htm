                  <p>The Generation Check Payments process generates
                     check payments in a predefined format for all payees who have a check
                     payment method and a net pay greater than zero. The format of printed
                     checks and the information printed on the checks and check stubs vary
                     based on your organization's requirements. When you submit the check
                     payment process, you must enter the starting check number, and optionally,
                     an ending check number. This topic explains now the check numbers
                     work when generating check payments.

                     <p>Enter the ending check number to put a break

                        submission parameters with the numbers printed on the checks. When
                        printing separate batches of consecutively numbered checks consider
                        your ending check numbers. For example, you have one box of checks
                        numbered 4500 through 4999 and another box numbered 7000 through 7999.
                        If you don't enter the last check number in the range and print more
                        than 500 checks, the payment process will record incorrect check numbers
                        for checks from the second box. To ensure the process stops when the
                        printer runs out of a batch of checks, enter the ending check number

                     <p>You can reverse a payroll calculation after
                        generating a payment, such as a check issued to the wrong person.
                        This differs from the Roll Back action, which you can only perform
                        if payment wasn't issued. The reversal process generates a negative
                        run result to offset the original run result, and maintains an audit
                        trail. Reversal doesn't affect the payment itself, only the payroll
                        run results and costing results.

                     <p>Some reports, such as the Payroll Activity and Payroll
                        Register reports, include a submission parameter for Balances Reported.
                        This parameter determines whether the report lists payment and nonpayment
                        balances for reversals and balance adjustments. For example, you might
                        process a reversal and include the negative net payment in the next
                        prepayments process. You submit the Payroll Register report and select
                        the option to list payment balances only. You then use this report
                        to review payroll results and compare balances with other reports
                        you've run.

                     <p>Your payroll checks expire after 90 days, and you
                        receive a notification that an employee never cashed a check that
                        you issued four months ago.

                     <p>Corrective Action:</p>
                     <p>Void the original check. Run the Generate Check Payments

                     <p>You must archive payroll results before you
                        submit processes that use archived data, such as Run Payroll Register,
                        Generate Payslips, and for some legislative data groups, Generate
                        Check Payments. Your payroll cycle flow should reflect the proper
                        sequence of tasks. If you submit standalone payroll processes, you
                        can archive the results using the Archive Periodic Payroll Results
                        task in the Payment Distribution work area.

                     <p>No, you can't roll back the payment process
                        after you generate a payment. If the original check payment is correct
                        but lost or destroyed, you can void and reissue it. An exception would
                        be if something had damaged all of the checks in a payment run. In
                        this case, because the application generated but didn't issue payments,
                        you could roll back and rerun the entire payment process.

                     <p>You can run the check or EFT payment process
                        as part of the payroll cycle flow or as a standalone process from
                        the Payment Distribution work area. The payment process generates
                        third-party payments for all deduction elements included in the process
                        using the flow submission parameters you specify. Payment methods
                        for all third-party payees must already exist.
