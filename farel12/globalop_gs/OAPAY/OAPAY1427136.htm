                     Balances page of the Payroll Calculation work area. After you complete
                     the adjustment, you submit the Costing of Balance Adjustment process

                                 It distributes the costs based on the ratio each element contributes
                                 to the total amount for the distribution group.
                              </p>
                              <p>If an element in the distribution group produces no run results,
                                 the application distributes the results to the remaining members.

                     <p>You have a partial payroll period for a weekly payroll
                        that begins Saturday, July 29 and ends Friday, August 4. Your accounting
                        periods are monthly, so you submit the Partial Period Accrual process,
                        and specify July 31 for the Process Date. You select a date for the
                        Previous Payroll Period parameter that include similar costs. If the
                        estimated cost is 210 USD, the process creates:

                           <p>The process
                              debits 90 USD to the cost account and credits 90 USD to the offset

                           </p>
                           
                           <p>The Partial Period Accrual process uses the Process
                              Date of July 31 that you specified when you submitted the process. 
                           </p>

                           <p>The process credits 90 USD
                              to the cost account, and debits 90 USD to the offset account, with
                              the accounting date of July 4.

                           <p>The Partial Period Accrual Reversal process checks
                              for the Accounting Date for Transfer to General Ledger parameter specified

                              Maintenance work area. Your enterprise uses the payroll period end
                              date for partial period accrual reversals, which in this example is
                              August 4.
                           </p>

                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>Later, you process the payroll for the period ending
                        August 4, and submit the Transfer to Subledger Accounting process.
                        The costing for the payroll run creates entries for the actual costs
                        and reverses the partial period accrual entries. The accounting date
                        is based on the Accounting Date for Transfer to General Ledger. Your
                        enterprises uses the process date of the actual payroll run for the
                        accounting date.

                     <p>You can then submit the Create Accounting process
                        from Oracle Enterprise Scheduler and review the results created for
                        the draft journal entries before running the final accounting.

                           report lists the costing result for the deduction and shows the department
