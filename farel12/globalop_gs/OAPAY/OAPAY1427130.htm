                     <p>An element's input values define the entry values
                        available on each entry of this element. For each element input value
                        set to display, you see an entry value on the Manage Element Entries
                        page. You use some entry values to provide inputs to element calculations,
                        such as hours worked.

                     <p>Other entry values store results from payroll calculations,
                        for example of elements processed earlier in the payroll run. Some
                        entry values are required and some have defaults or lists of values,
                        depending on the element setup.

                        such as hiring a person or loading data may create some cards automatically.
                        Otherwise, you can create the card manually. You can also add components

                        values. Additionally, you can associate the card with a tax reporting
                        unit.

                        override values defined in a calculation value definition. For example,
                        you might set a default tax rate for the legislative data group, and
                        allow the rate to be overridden by a flat amount entered on a personal
                        calculation card.

                        override values on calculation cards. It also provides the order in
                        which the Calculate Payroll process checks for values entered on calculation
                        cards. When the process finds an entered value, it stops checking
                        and uses the values defined at that level.

                        for each combination of legislative data group, payment type, and
                        currency that you use to disburse wages and other compensation. You
                        can also create rules for validating or processing the distribution
                        of payments. Create as many organization payment methods as required
                        for your enterprise. Use the Manage Organization Payment Methods page
                        in the Payment Distribution work area.

                           the US, the payment type for EFT is Direct Deposit; in the UK it's
                           BACS, and in Australia it's BECS.

                           When selecting the EFT payment type, you can enter

                           or both. Entries at the payment source level take priority over entries
                           at the organization payment level. For example, if you define details
                           at the payment source level, then to use those details when processing
                           payments, you must enter the payment source when submitting the payment
                           process.

                           associated with an active bank account in Oracle Fusion Cash Management.
                           If you define additional details at the payment source level, then

                     <p>A payroll relationship represents the association
                        between a person and a payroll statutory unit, which is the legal entity responsible for employee payment. Payroll
                        relationships group a person's assignment records based on the payroll
                        statutory calculation and reporting requirements. Payroll relationships
                        also facilitate the capture and extraction of HR and payroll-related
                        data sent to a third party, such as a payroll provider for payroll
                        processing.

                     <p>Payroll processing always occurs at the payroll relationship
                        level. When you display the results of a payroll process for a person,
                        you start by selecting the person's payroll relationship record and
                        then drill down to view details.

                     <p>Payroll relationships aggregate balances at the payroll
                        relationship level. Within a payroll relationship, payroll processes
                        can aggregate balances for multiple employment terms and assignment
                        records. Balances don't span payroll relationships.

                           The application compares the start date of the new terms or assignment
                           to the last standard earnings date of the existing payroll relationship.

                        <p>Anthony has two terms, one on a weekly payroll and
                           one on a monthly payroll. On 10 June 2014, an HR manager terminated
                           Anthony's employment terms record on the weekly payroll. The termination
                           process automatically set the last standard process date to the end
                           date of the payroll period. Anthony's termination package specifies
                           that he should receive compensation payments through the month of
                           June. To ensure he is paid on both the weekly and monthly payroll
                           through June, you change the last standard process date on the weekly
                           payroll to 30 June 2014.

                     <p>The following example illustrates how to
                        set up a user-defined time definition and associate it with elements so that payroll
                        administrators can extend the latest entry date for severance payments
                        to employees.

                        <p>The InFusion Corporation makes severance payments,
                           including regular salary, car allowance, and alimony. For most terminated
                           employees, these payments should end on the termination date. However,
                           payroll administrators must be able to extend payments for employees
                           who receive severance pay.

                        <p>When you create an element, you select the latest
                           entry date. The options are predefined time definitions: last standard
                           earnings date, last standard process date, or final close
                           date. Typically, standard earnings elements use the last standard
                           earnings date. However, this option doesn't support severance payments
                           because you can't extend it beyond the termination date.

                        <p>To support severance payments, InFusion creates a
                           user-defined time definition based on last standard earnings date
                           and selects it as the latest entry date for payments after termination.
                           On the payroll relationship record of terminated employees, the value
                           of the user-defined time definition is the termination date by default,
                           but payroll administrators can edit it to extend payments for certain
                           employees.

                     <p>Manage costing at the person level to track
                        costs for people in your enterprise. Cost all the elements the person
                        is eligible to receive or cost individual elements. You can also split
                        the cost across accounts, for example, to divide the cost of a person's
                        salary between two departments. Use the Manage Costing for Persons
                        task in the Accounting Distribution work area.

                        worked between two managers at different cost centers, and how to
                        override costing for a specific element at the assignment level.

                           marketing division. You learn that for the next 6 months Joe will
                           spend 40 percent of his time creating presentations for the sales
                           division. With the exception of the parking allowance, which you continue
                           to cost to the marketing division, you must split his costs between
                           the two divisions.

                        statutory reports at the end of a quarter or year. You can also use
                        the balance adjustment process in situations where, an employee moves
                        at the end of the year and you don't receive a notification in time.
                        You might adjust the employee's tax balance and refund the amount
                        collected by mistake.

                           which means that limits aren't verified. Before performing an adjustment,
                           consider whether related balances require adjustment, and whether
                           your adjustment exceeds statutory regulated limits. For example, raising
                           the upper limit of one balance might require correcting the lower
                           limit of a related balance and ensuring that they both meet statutory
                           limits.

                                 data group and limit the size of each batch to 5000 lines.

                        <p>The best practice is to adjust the balance
                           of an existing element, instead of creating a new element for balance
                           adjustment purposes. Creating a new element isn't recommended because
                           you must create the balance feeds and input values, and ensure that
                           you adjust all the related balances.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>When you create an element using the Manage Elements
                           task, you complete a template to create the element definition. For
                           some element classifications, submitting the template automatically
                           creates related elements, such as results elements.

                        <p>You adjust the appropriate input values required
                           to adjust the balance. For example, you might enter a different start
                           date for a pension plan element, or geography values for an earnings
                           element.  If you adjust an element processed in a payroll period,
                           input values that you skip use the values from the original entry. 
                        </p>

                           submit the Payroll Activity to view balance adjustments before archiving

                           an overtime earnings element, you can override the usual costing process
                           by specifying a cost account for the amount.

                           costing processes the amount to the suspense account. This situation
                           occurs because no values for the earnings group are associated with
                           the balance adjustment results. To correct the amount and costing
                           of the distributed elements, process a cost adjustment for the results

                        <p>Your enterprise initialized balances during a mid-year
                           implementation on June 30. The initial balance included a life insurance
                           deduction for Marie Kleim for 200 USD, instead of 300 USD. In the
                           monthly payroll on July 31, Marie's payroll run results included a
                           50 USD deduction for her life insurance, which brings the year-to-date
                           total to 250 USD. Marie received her July 31 payment, so it's not
                           practical to roll back the run result to correct the underlying entry.
                           Also, the balance adjustment to her life insurance deduction doesn't
                           affect her taxable wages. You correct the balance by submitting an
                           adjustment of 100 USD for Marie's life insurance deduction.

                           date of the last period, such as the month, quarter, or year. When
