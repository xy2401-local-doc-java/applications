                     <p>Retroactive pay is the recalculation of prior
                        payroll results due to changes that occur after the original calculation
                        was run. To process retroactive pay, run the Recalculate Payroll for
                        Retroactive Changes process. This process creates retroactive element
                        entries based on retroactive events. You can view automatically-created
                        retroactive events or create them manually. Only elements that are
                        set up to include a retroactive event group can have retroactive element

                     <p>Normally you create retroactive adjustments,
                        such as backdated salary changes, which automatically create retroactive
                        events. This example shows how to create a retroactive event manually.
                        In this example an employee, whose pay rate was supposed to change
                        last pay period, is being terminated. Payroll hasn't made the change
                        yet, so we need to add the retroactive event manually to generate
                        the correct payslip

                     <p>The calculation of payroll run results begins
                        with identifying the payroll relationships and element entries to
                        process. A series of gross-to-net calculations based on legislative
                        requirements create run results and balances. You can verify these
                        results by viewing the statement of earnings and payroll reports.
                        If you implement costing, the process also calculates the cost distributions.

                                 and the formula for calculating a deduction might have a prerequisite

                                 current exchange rate and rounds the monetary result based on the

                     <p>You can set a predefined sequence in which
                        a payroll run will process elements. An element's primary classification defines a default
                        processing priority for the element in payroll runs. Lower priority
                        numbers process first.

                        <p>Most classifications also have a priority range. To
                           set the priority you edit the element on the Element Summary page.
                           Setting a specific priority is useful if you need to establish the
                           order in which the element processes with respect to other elements
                           in the classification.

                        <p>Sometimes you must prioritize the processing of certain
                           element entries for an individual person. For example, you may need
                           to determine the precise order in which deductions taken for wage
                           attachments process for a person. In this case you can enter a subpriority
                           number for element entries.

                     <p>Use the Calculate QuickPay task to submit
                        a flow that calculates the run results for a person without waiting
                        for the standard payroll run. For example, use it to process new-hire
                        or termination payments, or to pay people whose records you removed
                        from the standard run for further processing.

                        for the search, the QuickPay process displays a single page and checklist.
                        It populates parameters, such as the person's payroll, date earned,
                        and flow name. You can override these parameters.

                        and prepayments, and processing an external payment. You can replace
                        the default QuickPay pattern with a customized QuickPay flow pattern
                        by adding your flow pattern to a user-defined table.

                     <p>This example demonstrates how to submit a
                        QuickPay flow for an employee to correct a calculation error that
                        occurs in the main payroll run. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In this scenario, you complete the payroll calculation
                        but not the prepayments calculation for the weekly payroll run. HR
                        informs you that an employee took unpaid leave earlier in the month.
                        You roll back the employee's payroll calculation to remove the person
                        from the payroll run, and continue processing the weekly payroll and
                        issue the payments. When you receive details about the leave from
                        HR, you update the employee's records. You submit a QuickPay process
                        to calculate the payroll run and prepayments for the employee, and
                        to process an external payment.

                           task for your biweekly payroll flow when you receive notification
                           to process the pay for a new hire. You want to generate an EFT payment
                           for the new hire rather than issue an external payment. In your enterprise,
                           you archive payroll results before generating payments. You use the
                           Calculate QuickPay task to start the QuickPay process, and interact
                           with the biweekly payroll flow, as shown in the following table. You
                           select the <span class="uicontrol">Use to Calculate Results</span> option so that the biweekly payroll flow includes the results of
                           the QuickPay process.

                     <p>Use the Manage Group Usages task from the Payroll

                           productivity techniques. To identify exceptional sales staff in the
                           organization, you can run a report that lists workers whose commissions
                           increased by 25 percent compared to their averages for the previous
                           3 months. To find out who the sales leaders are, set up a balance
                           exception using the values in the following table.

                     <p>Use balance exception reports to identify
                        potential overpayments or underpayments. Comparison types define the
                        period that is used to determine whether an exception has occurred.
                        Variance operators enable you to specify the precise range of variance
                        that you want to report on.

                           You can write a fast formula using the Balance Exception
                           formula type to return a variance value that you can use for identifying
                           exceptions for a balance. To use this feature, select the <span class="uicontrol">Formula</span> variance type on the Create Balance
                           Exception page and then select the formula that you created from the

                        reversal calculations before calculating prepayments.

                     <p>You can use the dynamic payroll relationship
                        group parameter functionality to run the Payroll Activity Report.
                        Use payroll relationship groups to define a set of people for payroll
                        processing, data entry, or reporting. For example, use the Payroll
                        Relationship Group formula type to restrict the payroll run to a specific
                        employee group, based on assignment and person level attributes.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Use the Manage Fast Formulas task to first create
                        a fast formula of the Payroll Relationship Group type. You can then
                        create a formula with specific criteria to define this group.  Use
                        this payroll relationship group as a submission parameter when you
                        run the Payroll Activity Report.

                        If you add a delivery option to the report's extract definition, you
