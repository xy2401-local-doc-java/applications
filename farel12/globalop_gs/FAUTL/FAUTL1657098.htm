      members' work schedules, including approved absences and public holidays. They can quickly analyze and edit workload coverage
      using indicators of total hours scheduled, resources required, and resources scheduled. The View Published Schedules page
      is a read-only version of the Manage Planned Schedule page in terms of appearance and coverage indicators. However, the schedule
      and coverage data can be different between the two pages because schedulers can create, edit, and save a planned schedule
      without publishing it. The published schedule is the schedule that workers are expected to comply with. Workers can use the

                        applied to that schedule to override resource availability for that
