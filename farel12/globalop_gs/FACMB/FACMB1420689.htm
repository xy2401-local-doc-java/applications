                  <p>Use reinstatement rules to control how life
                     event processing restores participant elections when you back out
                     and reprocess a life event. You select reinstatement rules on the
                     Life Event tab of the Enrollment page when you create or edit a program
                     or plan in the Plan Configuration work area.

                     a participant to make changes to some benefit offerings and then you
                     reprocess the open event. Reprocessing restores the original participant
                     elections, depending on the reinstatement rule that you configured
                     for the open event.

                     care and dependent care reimbursement, typically must start new every
                     calendar year.
