                        Contract statuses are predefined and you cannot define

                        and use them, for example, to pass the contract from one team to another
                        for review before submitting the contract for approval.

                     <p>To create a billing control for a contract,
                        you must enable billing controls for the associated contract type.
                        You can create billing controls for a contract or contract line to
                        limit the amounts, billing resources, dates, and funds available for
                        billing consumption. The following scenario demonstrates how billing
                        controls regulate the transactions that are invoiced and recognized
                        for revenue.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>In this example, the contract type has billing controls
                        enabled with a hard limit. The contract has two contract lines. A
                        default billing control was automatically created for each contract
                        line, using the line amount as the hard limit. A default billing control
                        was also automatically created at the contract header level, with
                        a hard limit equal to the sum of the hard limits for the two contract
                        lines. A soft limit was manually entered for these default billing
                        controls. Two additional billing controls were manually created for
                        Contract Line 1, to further restrict invoicing and revenue recognition.
                        The following table displays the billing controls.

                        <p>You can either associate a project and task
                           to a contract line, or a project without any tasks to a contract line.
                           If you associate a project without any tasks to a contract line,
                           any future associations of that project to another contract line cannot
                           include a task.

                        <p>If you associate a project and task to a contract
                           line, you can perform the following actions for future associations:
                           Associate the same project and task to another contract line Associate
                           a task in another branch of the same project hierarchy to the same
                           or another contract line. For example, if you associate Project 1,
                           Task 1 to Contract A, Line 1, you can associate in Project 1, Task
                           2.2.1 to Contract A, Lines 1 and 2, and also Contract B, Line 1.

                        <p>To select a task from another level in the same branch
                           of the task hierarchy, you must first inactivate the existing associated
                           project and task. In the example above, before you can associate Project
                           1, Task 1.1 to Contract A, Line 1, you must inactivate the existing
                           association between Project 1, Task 1 and Contract A, Line 1.

                        <p>Yes, but only if you derive rates for an intercompany
                           contract based on an organization hierarchy structure instead of the
                           bill rates defined on a bill plan. The contract line and bill plan
                           architecture allows you to specify a different bill plan for each
                           provider and receiver organization. Select a bill rate or burden rate
                           schedule for each of your contract bill plans. However, if your rates
                           are defined at a granular level, you may need to derive rates for
                           an organization hierarchy structure using transfer price rules.
