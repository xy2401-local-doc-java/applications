                  <p>Because invoicing is done at the contract level,
                     an invoice can contain transactions from multiple projects and tasks.
                     Additionally, charges from an expenditure item or event can be split
                     across multiple invoices if the project task is associated with multiple
                     contracts. A billing transaction represents a mapping between an expenditure
                     item or event, a contract line, and an invoice line. Billing transactions
                     are created by the invoice preprocessor API during the invoice generation
                     process. If you generate revenue for a contract prior to generating

                     generation program.

                  <p>Contract number is an alphanumeric attribute.
                     The contract number range includes all contracts with a value equal
                     to or greater than the From value but less than or equal to the To
                     value.

                     If you use contract number ranges extensively, then
                     use a fixed length numeric contract number. Using a fixed length numeric
                     contract number simplifies the process of defining the contract number
                     range and makes it more comprehensive. Precede the contract number
                     with the required number of zeros to ensure that the length is always
                     fixed.

                     <p>Access to invoices is secured by the business
                        unit. You only have access to invoices that belong to contracts in
                        the business unit assigned to your role. You can see all invoices
                        for projects that are linked to the contracts which you can access.

                     <h3>What happens if I search for an invoice by project?</h3>
                     <p>You have the option of searching for invoices
                        by project. When you open the invoice, your view of the invoice amounts
                        is restricted to transactions from that project only. The invoice
                        does not display amounts from other projects associated with the contract.
                        The queried amount on the invoice contains the amount of total invoice
                        distributions for the project and task entered in your search criteria.

                        the invoice to review the details, then you will see a value for the
                        queried amount. The queried amount on an invoice is from the project
                        in your search criteria. The queried amount does not contain amounts
                        from other projects that have transactions on the invoice.
                     </p>
                     <p>The invoice amount is the amount of transactions
                        from all projects that contributed to the invoice.

                     <p>Intercompany billing creates internal invoices
                        and accounting entries to pass costs and share revenue across organizations
                        on an intercompany billing contract. A provider organization performs
                        work and charges it a project owned by the receiver organization.
                        The provider organization creates an invoice in Oracle Fusion Receivables
                        and the receiver organization imports the invoice from Oracle Fusion
                        Payables. Accounting entries for revenue are created between the organizations.
                     </p>
                     <p>Interproject billing creates internal invoices
                        for costs incurred between a provider project and a receiver project
                        defined on an interproject billing contract. The provider project
                        generates an Oracle Fusion Receivables invoice, which the receiver
                        project receives as an Oracle Payables invoice.

                        <p>The two major components of invoice generation involve
                           creating the billing transactions and creating the invoice.

                        <p>The first step of the Generate Invoice process evaluates
                           the eligibility of expenditure items and events for invoicing, maps
                           them to contract lines, and updates the funding amount for the contract
                           line. If an expenditure item or event passes the billing controls,
                           a mapping record is created for a combination of the transaction,
                           contract line, and funded amount. This intermediate mapping record,
                           the billing transaction, is placed on the invoice and is updated each
                           time that you generate an invoice for the contract until the sum of
                           its mappings are 100 percent.

                        <p>Next, invoice lines and distributions are created from
                           the eligible billing transactions during the Generate Invoice process.
                           Distributions are grouped into invoice lines and the invoice header
                           using the rules defined on the invoice format. Optionally, create
                           distributions manually by attaching the eligible expenditure items
                           and events on the invoice to the invoice lines.

                     <p>This example illustrates how to create a separate
                        invoice line for each contract line.

                        <p>You are required to prepare an invoice using a standardized
                           method of construction contract billing and to invoice the work in
                           accordance with a schedule of values. A schedule of values, or a contractor's
                           application for payment, typically contains a detailed description
                           of the work, value of the completed work, value of materials, and
                           value of the balance required to finish the work.
                        </p>
                        <p>The schedule of values drives the invoicing, which
                           takes place by invoice line. To meet this request, you capture invoice
                           amounts by contract line. For contract lines with a sell intent, item,
                           and project-based line type source, invoicing must use invoice formats
                           with grouping option that includes contract line. Usage of invoice
                           formats with grouping option results in the transfer of inventory
                           item and related attributes from contract line to invoice line in
                           Oracle Fusion Receivables. These contract line attributes come from
                           the currently or previously active, expired, hold, or closed contract
                           version.

                     <p>This example demonstrates how to create an

                        and materials. During invoice review, you discover two hotel charges
                        that should not be on the invoice. Adjust the invoice by changing
                        the transactions to nonbillable and update the invoice amount.

                     <h3>Invoice and Revenue Rates: How They Are Determined</h3>
                     <p>Oracle Fusion Project Billing uses bill rates,
                        burdening, and transfer price schedules to derive standard bill rates,
                        multipliers, markups, and bases for calculating potential revenue
                        when the revenue method classification on a revenue plan is as billed, as incurred,
                        or rate based. Similarly, bill rates derive invoice amounts when the invoice method

                        <p>There are two methods for calculating percent complete.
                           Percent complete for an entire contract is automatically calculated
                           when you update progress for the associated projects. Oracle Fusion
                           Project Billing calculates the percent complete amount for each contract
                           line as the sum of earned value effort multiplied by 100, divided
                           by the sum of baseline effort.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>To manually calculate percent complete, enter the published
                           project progress on the contract or override the percent complete
                           for a specific contract line or associated project, and submit the
                           Generate Invoice process. Depending on the contract configuration,
                           Oracle Fusion Project Billing calls the percent complete billing extension
                           for each:

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Project Billing uses the percent
                        spent invoice method to invoice customers as progress is calculated.
                        Assigning the percent spent invoice method to a bill plan automatically
                        adds the percent spent invoice billing extension to the bill plan.
                        Percent spent invoice amounts are calculated by the percent spent
                        invoice billing extension which creates an invoice event with the

                           Programming Interface (API) called automatically during invoice generation.
                           The invoice preprocessor checks invoice eligibility for contracts,
                           contract lines, bill plans, projects, expenditure items and events.
                           The invoice preprocessor then creates billing transactions for those
                           eligible items.

                           the amount of a transaction that could not be invoiced or recognized

                           generation. If you have a billing transaction exception, perform the
                           indicated corrective action on the transaction, then generate the
                           invoice or revenue again.

                        <p>The tax amount on a contract invoice is an

                           Transaction Tax Quote defined in Oracle Fusion Tax. Oracle Fusion
                           Receivables calculates the final tax amounts using the Invoice tax
                           event class. If the setup for the two event classes differs in Oracle

                           Receivables, then the tax amounts shown in the two applications can
                           differ.

                     <p>When you change a bill rate override on a bill plan
                        and amend the contract, the application marks all transactions that
                        have a transaction date on or after the contract amendment effective
                        date for adjustment processing. To recalculate and display the revised
                        bill rates, perform these actions within the Contract Invoices work

                        to see if any further action is required.

                           affect the invoice amount. When such amendments are activated, previously
                           processed transactions are not adjusted automatically. If you want
                           an unreleased invoice to reflect the amended contract values, you
                           must generate the invoice again, with the delete draft, approved,

                           automatically deletes the previous invoice and creates a new invoice,
                           with amended contract values from the currently active contract version.

                           As you investigate, you find that the invoice contains charges for
                           hotel telephone calls that were inadvertently marked as billable.
                           You take the transactions off the current invoice by removing them
                           and setting them as nonbillable. As a result, the application does

                     <h3>Invoice Lines: Explained</h3>
                     <p>An invoice contains expenditure items and billing
                        events grouped into invoice lines. In addition to the expenditure
                        items and billing events which are present on an invoice line, there
                        may be eligible and unbilled billing transactions for an invoice line.
                        When you perform the action to attach an eligible or unbilled billing
                        transaction to an invoice line, it becomes part of the
                        invoice line amount.
                     </p>
                     <p>Invoice lines consist of line details, eligible billing
                        transactions, and unbilled billing transactions. Manage adjustments

                        <p>Line details are the billing transactions for
                           expenditure items and billing events which are represented in the

                        <p>The eligible billing transactions on an invoice
                           represent expenditure items and events that are partially invoiced
                           for project tasks linked to the contract, and have at least one billing
                           transaction. Depending on your adjustment action, transactions move
                           to either the invoice line details or unbilled transactions from here.
                        </p>

                        <p>When you hold a transaction from invoicing
                           or revenue recognition, the transaction will not be selected during
                           the invoice or revenue generation processes. If you hold the transaction
                           from invoicing once, it will be picked up the next time you generate
                           invoices. If you hold the transaction from invoicing or revenue recognition
                           indefinitely, you must remove the hold and submit the invoice or revenue
                           generation process again. Only at that time will the transaction become
                           eligible for invoicing or revenue recognition.

                        <p>The bill plan for the transaction uses a fixed
                           invoice format. A fixed invoice format prevents you from attaching
                           transactions to invoice lines.

                           amount are updated.  Correspondingly, if you remove the link between

                           are updated. Perform this action if the invoice format for the bill
                           plan associated with the transactions is not a fixed format.

                           when hard limit is reached, remove the transaction from the invoice
                           by placing it on invoice hold, from the Edit Invoice page.
