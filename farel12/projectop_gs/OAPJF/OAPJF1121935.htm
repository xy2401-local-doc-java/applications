                        concerns on the issues related to product testing. The resolution
                        to the issues requires collaboration between project members. You
                        create a conversation and invite the project manager, functional experts,
                        and other members on the project discussion.

                     <p>Conversations are online discussions that include

                        their views, provide information, and upload documents. Information
                        is shared as if everyone were working together in the same room.

                     <p>Define transaction controls to specify the
                        types of transactions that are chargeable or nonchargeable for projects
                        and tasks. Use transaction controls to configure your projects and
                        tasks to allow only charges that you expect or plan. You can also
                        define which items are billable and nonbillable on your projects that
                        are enabled for billing. For capital projects, you can define which
                        items are capitalizable and noncapitalizable.

                     <p>You can create any combination of transaction controls
                        that you want. For example, you can create a transaction control for
                        a specific person and expenditure type, or you can create a combination
                        for a person, expenditure type, and nonlabor resource. You also specify
                        the date range to which each transaction control applies. If you don't
                        enter transaction controls, you can charge expenditure items from
                        any person, expenditure category, expenditure type, and nonlabor resource
                        to all lowest tasks on the project.

                           charge only labor to your project, you define a transaction control
                           with the Labor expenditure category, and allow charges to the project
                           or task.

                     <p>Capitalized interest is an estimate of the
                        interest cost incurred when you invest in long-term capital projects. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Subject to accounting rules and regulatory guidelines,
                        you can capitalize interest as part of the total cost of acquiring
                        and constructing assets that require an extended period to be ready
                        for use. To support this requirement, Oracle Fusion Projects can calculate
                        and record capitalized interest for capital projects. You can recognize
                        multiple types of capital interest on your projects. For example,
                        you can calculate capitalized interest separately for interest types
                        such as debt and equity.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Oracle Fusion Projects calculates capitalized interest
                        on open construction-in-process (CIP) amounts. You can spread the
                        cost for one expenditure item across multiple assets. If you have
                        previously capitalized any of the assets to which the cost is allocated,
                        then the total item cost is excluded from the interest calculation.

                     <p>A burden schedule is specified at the project
                        type, project, or task for a fixed date. When you change the burden
                        schedule, you can propagate the change from the project to all existing
                        tasks. You can change the burden schedule assignment on the project
                        and tasks independently. You don't need to change the burden schedule
                        on each task separately. To selectively cascade the burden schedule
                        change, consider one of the following task assignment options:

                     <p>A key performance indicator (KPI) enables you
                        to define thresholds of possible values for a performance measure
                        for any project in a project unit. During KPI definition, you associate
                        a performance status indicator with each threshold level. When you
                        generate KPI values, the application compares the value against the
                        thresholds defined for the KPI. If the value falls within any of the
                        defined threshold levels, then the application associates the status
                        indicator of that threshold with the performance measure. The following
                        are the KPI components we will discuss:

                           threshold is used to determine the KPI status. For example, if a KPI

                        <p>A tolerance percentage is used to compare the previous
                           KPI value to the current value to show if the performance trend is
                           increasing, decreasing, or staying the same. For example, if the tolerance
                           percentage is 10 percent for a KPI, and the difference between the
                           previous KPI value and current value is greater than 10 percent, then
                           the trend is increasing. If the difference is greater than -10 percent,
                           then the trend is decreasing. If the difference is between -10 percent
                           and 10 percent, then the trend shows no change. A single tolerance
                           percentage value, such as 10 percent in this example, represents both
                           negative and positive tolerances.

                           process of generating KPI values uses this project performance data.
                           Before you generate new KPI values, check the date that the project
                           performance data was last generated to make sure that the data includes
                           all transactions that may impact project performance results. Then
                           decide if you must update project performance data before you generate
                           KPI values. After you run these programs you will have a true picture

                           select to replace the current KPI values, the KPI values generated

                           on November 18, 2010. You must select to replace the current KPI values
                           for a given period if you want to retain one set of KPI values and
                           review KPI values during the period.

                        <p>Use the <span class="uicontrol">Generate KPI Values</span> process to generate KPI values. KPI values are calculated based
                           on the value of the performance measure associated with the project.
                           When you generate KPI values, the KPI period determination date is
                           compared to the current date to determine the period. KPI values are
                           generated for the period based on the options in the key performance
                           indicator definition. Only one set of key performance indicators is
                           kept for a single KPI period determination date.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, KPI values are generated for a KPI period
                           determination date of August 24 at 8:15 a.m. for Projects A and B.
                           Then KPI values are generated for a KPI period determination date
                           of August 24 at 10:45 a.m. just for Project B. The KPI values for
                           Project B generated at 8:15 a.m. are deleted, but KPIs belonging to
                           Project A are retained.

                           definition. KPI threshold values are defined when KPIs are created.
                           Based on the threshold values defined, the status for tasks and resources
                           are calculated for the KPI values that are based on a percentage.
                           This example shows how the status of tasks and resources are calculated.
                           For example, assume that the KPI named ITD Nonbillable Cost as a Percentage
                           of Total Cost has the following threshold definition.

                     <p>In another example, the Consulting
                        resource breakdown structure contains a Labor resource. Labor is a

                        Max Martin, Robert Altima, and Fred Jones. The ITD Nonbillable Cost
                        as a Percentage of Total Cost KPI value for Labor is 12.97% (15,700.00/121,015.00).
                        The ITD Nonbillable Cost as a Percentage of Total Cost KPI value for
                        Fred Jones is 0%. Because the KPI value for each row in the hierarchical
                        structure is calculated separately, Labor has a status indicator of
                        Critical and Fred Jones does not have a status indicator.

                        as an exception even if the project has an On Track status indicator.
