                     <p>You can generate budget or forecast versions based
                        on other financial plans or from the project plan. During generation,
                        quantity from the source plan and rates derived from the target financial
                        plan type planning options are used to calculate amounts for the new
                        version. The planning resource breakdown structure is the only planning
                        option that is inherited from the source. You can't edit the planning
                        resource breakdown structure.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="infobox-note"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                        If a project is multicurrency enabled and its financial
                        plan type is not multicurrency enabled, you can only create budgets
                        using the financial plan.

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Copying Budget or Forecast Amounts</h3>
                     
                     <p>You can create a version by copying another financial
                        plan. Copy plan values without change, or specify a positive or negative
                        percentage by which to adjust amounts before the new version is created.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The copied version inherits planning options from the
                        source financial plan. You can't edit planning options for the new
                        version during initial creation.

                     <p>When you manually create a budget or forecast version,
                        the basic task structure is recreated without any quantities, rates,
                        or amounts. Budget or forecast dates are based on the planned dates
                        for tasks entered in the project plan. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To create the version efficiently, add the following
                        at the selected planning level:

                              placeholder resource so that you can enter amounts against tasks without
                              having to assign a planning resource.
                           </p>

                     <p>Depending on your access, you can edit planning options
                        inherited from the selected financial plan type. Of course, generation
                        options don't apply when manually creating versions.

                  <p>Financial plan types and
                     budget versions in Oracle Fusion Project Control contain attributes
                     that enable you to automatically create control budgets in Oracle
                     Fusion Budgetary Control. Configuring these attributes on a financial
                     plan type enable the budget versions that you create from that financial
                     plan type to create control budgets.

                     <p>This figure shows the components
                        of a financial plan type that you must configure to enable a project
                        budget version for creating a control budget in Oracle Fusion Budgetary
                        Control. The general budget information includes the plan class, planning
                        amounts, and the enable budgetary controls option. The budgetary control settings are the control budget, control level, default rate type,
                        and tolerance percentage.

                  <p>Create a control budget in Oracle Fusion
                     Budgetary Control from a project budget version to centrally enforce budgetary controls for sponsored and non-sponsored project transactions. When you create
                     a baseline version of a project budget version with budgetary control
                     attributes, you automatically create a control budget in Oracle Fusion
                     Budgetary Control.

                  <p>
                     <p>The following figure shows the
                        procedure for creating a control budget from a project budget version.
                        Create a budget version in Oracle Fusion Project Control, and review
                        or modify the budgetary control settings. Enter the budget lines,
                        and when you're satisfied with the budget, save the version and create
                        a baseline. Creating the baseline prompts Oracle Fusion Budgetary
                        Control to automatically validate and import the budget version, and
                        create a corresponding control budget.

                     <p>When deriving distribution factors and
                        percentages associated with estimate-to-complete (ETC) amounts for

                        applications use only the spread point values corresponding to the
                        ETC period. Therefore, the total distribution used to calculate distribution
                        percentages for ETC amounts is the total in the ETC period, and not
                        the total distribution for all periods.

                     <p>Yes. Reporting options for the focal version

                     <p>For example, if you select raw cost as the reporting
                        cost, then margin analysis is performed using raw cost for both the
                        focal version and the comparison versions.

                     <p>Another example: The focal version is created using
                        a financial plan type where cost and revenue are planned using the
                        same version. Here the focal version contains a single quantity and
                        that is used for comparison. If a comparison plan is based on a financial
                        plan type where cost and revenue are planned using separate versions,
                        then the reporting options (report quantity) for the focal version
                        determines whether quantity from the cost or the revenue version is
                        used to calculate variance.

                        At the financial plan type level, report quantity is
                        always cost quantity when planning for cost and revenue on the same
                        version. However, when reviewing budget or forecast versions, you

                        of the comparison plan.

                           segments. The application concatenates the project and top
                           resource names to create the segments. If a segment exceeds 50 characters,
                           the application automatically shortens the segment. The shortened
                           segment may have the same text as an existing segment.
