                        and staffing in Oracle Fusion Project Resource Management. Administrators
                        can create resources individually on the Manage Project Enterprise

                        set up qualifications and proficiency levels when they set up the

                  <p>During the search and evaluation of resources
                     to fulfill a project resource request, a resource manager can view resource
                     cost and bill rates and select a resource that meets the financial
                     requirements of a project. Project assignment rates provide the data
                     to calculate labor resource cost and bill amounts for analyzing margins
                     and revenue forecasts. Resource and project managers can adjust the
                     rates on project assignments to provide the most current reporting
                     information.

                        <p>A Resource Qualification score is made up of two scores:
                           a score for qualifications, such as competencies and language, and

                           consist only of structured content types, then the Resource Qualification
                           score is the sum of the resource's individual structured content scores
                           divided by the total number of qualifications.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the qualifications on a project resource request
                           consist only of unstructured keywords, then the Resource Qualification
                           score is the sum of the resource's individual keyword scores divided
                           by the total number of qualifications.

                           then the Resource Qualification score is the average of the structured
                           content score and keyword score. For example, if a resource has a
                           structured content score of 100% and a keyword score of 80%, then
                           the Resource Qualification score is 90% for the project resource request.

                     <p>To determine a resource's score for
                        all keywords on a request, the application divides the sum of individual

                        If you change the resource pools that you search
                        on the Search and Evaluate Resources page, the resource with highest
                        number of keyword occurrences may change in the search results. This
                        change may impact resource keyword scores because the denominator
                        changes in the relative calculation.

                      <h4 class="topictitle">Simple Keyword Scores</h4> 
                     <p>If you are considering only one resource to fulfill
                        a project resource request, the keyword score is based on whether
                        the resource profile or resume has at least one occurrence of each
                        requested keyword. This is a simple calculation, for example:
                     </p> 
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>If a resource has one or more occurrences
                              of a requested keyword, then the individual keyword score is 100%
                              for the resource.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>If a project resource request contains
                              two keywords, and a resource has one occurrence of the first keyword
                              and zero occurrences of the second keyword, then the individual keyword
                              score for the resource is 50%.
                           </p>
                        </li>

                        Because of the difference in relative and simple
                        keyword score calculations, a Resource Qualification score might be
                        different on the Resource Details page that you open directly from
                        the project resource request than the score for the same resource
                        on the Search and Evaluate Resources page. The score on the Resource
                        Details page that you open from the request is based on the simple
                        calculation because you aren't comparing resources. The score on the
                        Search and Evaluate Resources page is based on the relative calculation
                        for all resources in the search results.

                      <h4 class="topictitle">Resource Qualification Score Example</h4> 
                     <p>In this example, a project resource request contains
                        qualifications for a competency, degree, and language. The request
                        also contains one keyword. The resource manager is evaluating the
                        suitability of three resources to fulfill the request based on the
                        Resource Qualification scores. The following table lists the individual
                        qualification and keyword scores that make up each Resource Qualification
                        score.
