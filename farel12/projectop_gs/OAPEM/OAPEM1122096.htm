                  <p>As a project manager, you can use the Project
                     Management work area to manage the complete project lifecycle. First
                     create projects for work planning, then work with the project administrator
                     to enable the project for financial management. Alternatively, the
                     project administrator can create the project with financial management
                     enabled in the Project Financial Management work area. Use one of
                     the following methods to create a project for financial management:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Create projects in the Project
                           Management work area, create financial tasks, and enable attributes,
                           such as chargeable and billable. Later when you are ready for financial
                           planning, a project administrator can enable the project for financial
                           management from the Project Financial Management work area, Tasks
                           panel tab.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Create projects in the Project
                           Financial Management work area. After the project administrator creates
                           the project, then the project manager can manage the complete project
                           lifecycle in the Project Management work area.
                        </p>

                     <p>In many circumstances, project managers may
                        need to create a project for planning, scheduling, or proposal purposes,
                        without the need for financial management. The project manager can
                        quickly create a project, add tasks, and plan resources. For example,
                        you have a project related to a sales opportunity and the project
                        manager must assess the schedule and staffing needs. The project can
                        then continue indefinitely without financial management, or the project
                        administrator can enable financial management for the project.

                        work area so that financial management is already enabled. For example,
                        the project is approved and resources need to report time and expenses
                        against the project immediately. You can do so by creating the project
                        using a project template or another project. Create any new work planning
                        tasks as subtasks of the financial tasks.

                  <p>You use scheduling when you change task dependencies or constraints in the project plan. Manually scheduled tasks are not updated in
                     this process.

                  <p>Dates for automatically scheduled tasks are updated
                     as follows:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Dependent tasks are scheduled based
                           on the changes you make to predecessor task dates.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Tasks with constraints are scheduled
                           based on the type of constraint. If the constraint type is <span class="uicontrol">Start on or after</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Finish on or after</span>, the constraint date takes priority
                           over the calculated start or finish date of the task.
                        </p>
                     </li>

                  <p>The application schedules the project plan using the
                     latest date between the project start date and the current date. You
                     may have scenarios where tasks have only dependencies, only constraints,
                     or both dependencies and constraints. The example shows tasks in a
                     project plan with task start and finish dates, and constraints and
                     dependencies assigned. You can understand how the application schedules
                     task dates when you make changes.

                  <p>You can also provide a number of days of time lag
                     when you create a dependency. The lag allows you to have a gap of
                     a few additional days between two dependent tasks. In the example,
                     if you assign a lag time of one day in the Finish-to-Start dependency
                     between Task 1 and Task 2, then the start date of Task 2 moves to
                     November 23, and the finish date moves to November 26.

                        The task dates of all automatically scheduled tasks are adjusted during
                        scheduling. If a task has more than one predecessor task, the task
                        date of the predecessor task with the latest date is assigned.

                     <p>Your implementation team selects a default project

                           Project Management Implementation Options</span> page. The default
                        project calendar is automatically assigned to new projects, and the
                        default resource calendar is automatically assigned to new project
                        enterprise labor resources.

                        requirements for a specific project, a project manager can select
                        another calendar during project creation. Similarly, if the default
                        resource calendar doesn't meet the scheduling requirements for a specific
                        project enterprise labor resource, the project application administrator
                        can assign another calendar to the resource.

                        days and total hours in the calendar are used to schedule the project
                        plan. The calendar also works with the project start and finish dates
                        to determine the project duration.

                     <p>If required, associate a schedule exception with the
                        selected calendar for the project plan. If you create an off period
                        exception, then the exception overrides any nonworking days and makes
                        them working days. If you create a work period exception, then the
                        exception overrides any working days and makes them nonworking days.
                        The project plan uses the schedule exceptions for calculating dates
                        or duration.

                     <p>When you create a work plan template from a project,
                        the work plan template copies project resources as planned resources.
                        The work plan template doesn't copy project-specific resources. If
                        a project enterprise resource exists in multiple roles, the work plan
                        template copies the resource for each role. If you create a work plan
                        template from a project plan that has resources in various statuses,
                        the application:

                        project plan from this work plan template, they can then replace these
                        generic resources with actual resources.

                     <p>Project calendars determine
                        standard working and nonworking times for resources working on projects.
                        For example, a project calendar can designate the total number of
                        working hours per day and any holidays that occur during the project
                        dates. A project calendar is used to schedule project tasks, and to
                        estimate project duration.

                        to a project. Similarly, a project application administrator can assign
                        a different calendar to a resource.
