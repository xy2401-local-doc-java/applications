                     <p>A project enterprise labor resource is a resource
                        that you can assign to multiple projects.

                     <p>A managed project enterprise
                        labor resource is a project enterprise labor resource whose availability
                        and staffing are managed in Oracle Fusion Project Resource Management.
                        You use managed project enterprise labor resources to fulfill project
                        resource requests and directly assign to one or more projects.
