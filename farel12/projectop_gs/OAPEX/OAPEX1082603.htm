                           transactions on behalf of many legal entities. Normally, it has
                           a manager, strategic objectives, a level of autonomy, and responsibility
                           for its profit and loss. Roll business units up into divisions if you structure your chart of accounts with this type of hierarchy.

                                 your business units with business functions that produce financial
                                 transactions.

                                 business data to prevent access by the domestic sales employees. To
                                 accomplish this security, set up the export business and domestic
                                 sales business as two separate business units.

                           types, across business units, or you can have each business unit manage
                           its own set depending on the level at which you want to enforce common
                           policies.

                           <p>A number of Oracle Fusion Applications use business
                              units to implement data security. You assign roles like Accounts Payable
                              Manager to users to permit them to perform specific functions, and
                              you assign business units for each role to users to give them access
                              to data in those business units. For example, users which have been
                              assigned a Payables role for a particular business unit, can perform
                              the function of payables invoicing on the data in that business unit.
                              Roles can be assigned to users manually using the Security Console,
                              or automatically using provisioning rules. Business Units can be assigned
                              to users using the Manage Data Access for Users task in Setup and
                              Maintenance.

                              and the US allows for companies to register in one state and do business
                              in all states. To support local reporting requirements, legal reporting
                              units are created and registered.

                              jurisdictions' requirements. Certain annual or more frequent accounting
                              reports are referred to as statutory or external reporting. These
                              reports must be filed with specified national and regulatory authorities.
                              For example, in the United States (US), your publicly owned entities
                              (corporations) are required to file quarterly and annual reports,
                              as well as other periodic reports, with the Securities and Exchange
                              Commission (SEC), which enforces statutory reporting requirements
                              for public corporations.

                              companies do not have to file separately. In other countries, your

                              at the public group level. Disclosure requirements are diverse. For
                              example, your local entities may have to file locally to comply with
                              local regulations in a local currency, as well as being included in

                           <p>A legal entity can represent all or part of your
                              enterprise's management framework. For example, if you operate in
                              a large country such as the United Kingdom or Germany, you might incorporate
                              each division in the country as a separate legal entity. In a smaller
                              country, for example Austria, you might use a single legal entity
                              to host all of your business operations across divisions.

                           of your legal entities. If you make purchases from or sell to other legal entities, define
                           these other legal entities in your customer and supplier registers.
                           These registers are part of the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Architecture.

                           your customer and supplier registers. Use legal entity relationships
                           to determine which transactions are intercompany and require intercompany
                           accounting. Your legal entities can be identified as legal employers
                           and therefore, are available for use in Human Capital Management (HCM)
                           applications.

                           <p>All of the assets of the enterprise are owned
                              by individual legal entities. Oracle Fusion Financials allow your
                              users to enter legal entities on transactions that represent a movement
                              in value or obligation.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>For example, a sales order creates an obligation
                              on the legal entity that books the order to deliver the goods on the
                              acknowledged date. The creation also creates an obligation on the
                              purchaser to receive and pay for those goods. Under contract law in
                              most countries, damages can be sought for both:

                                 <p>What is called loss of bargain,
                                    or the profit that would have made on a transaction.

                           <p>In another example, if you revalued your inventory
                              in a warehouse to account for raw material price increases, the revaluation
                              and revaluation reserves must be reflected in your legal entity's

                           <p>A business unit  can process transactions on behalf of many
                              legal entities. Frequently, a business unit is part of a single legal
                              entity. In most cases, the legal entity is explicit on your transactions.
                              For example, a payables invoice has an explicit legal entity field.
                              Your accounts payables department can process supplier invoices on
                              behalf of one or many business units.

                           <p>In some cases, your legal entity is inferred from
                              your business unit that is processing the transaction. For example,
                              Business Unit ACM UK has a default legal entity of InFusion UK Ltd.
                              When a purchase order is placed in ACM UK, the legal entity InFusion
                              UK Ltd is legally obligated to the supplier. Oracle Fusion Procurement,
                              Oracle Fusion Project Portfolio Management, and Oracle Fusion Supply
                              Chain applications rely on deriving the legal entity information from

                                 <p>Decide which balancing segments correspond
                                    to each legal entity and assign them in Oracle Fusion General Ledger
                                    Accounting Configuration Manager. Once you assign one balancing segment
                                    value in a ledger, then all your balancing segment values must be
                                    assigned. This recommended best practice facilitates reporting on
                                    assets, liabilities, and income by legal entity.
                                 </p>
                              </li>

                           <p>Represent your legal entities by at least one balancing
                              segment value. You may represent it by two or three balancing segment
                              values if more granular reporting is required. For example, if your
                              legal entity operates in multiple jurisdictions in Europe, you might
                              define balancing segment values and map them to legal reporting units. You
                              can represent a legal entity with more than one balancing segment
                              value. Do not use a single balancing segment value to represent more
                              than one legal entity.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>In Oracle Fusion General Ledger, there are three
                              balancing segments. You can use separate balancing segments to represent
                              your divisions or strategic business units to enable management reporting
                              at the balance sheet level for each. This solution is used to empower
                              your business unit and divisional managers to track and assume responsibility
                              for their asset utilization or return on investment. Using multiple
                              balancing segments is also useful when you know at the time of implementation
                              that you are disposing of a part of a legal entity and want to isolate
                              the assets and liabilities for that entity.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Implementing multiple balancing segments requires
                              every journal entry that is not balanced by division or business unit,
                              to generate balancing lines. You cannot change to multiple balancing
                              segments after you begin using the ledger because your historical
                              data is not balanced by the new balancing segments. Restating historical
                              data must be done at that point. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>If your enterprise regularly spins off businesses
                              or holds managers accountable for utilization of assets, identify
                              the business with a balancing segment value. If you account for each
                              legal entity in a separate ledger, no requirement exists to identify
                              the legal entity with a balancing segment value.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>While transactions that cross balancing segments
                              don't necessarily cross legal entity boundaries, all transactions
                              that cross legal entity boundaries must cross balancing segments.
                              If you make an acquisition or are preparing to dispose of a portion
                              of your enterprise, you may want to account for that part of the enterprise
                              in its own balancing segment even if the portion is not a separate
                              legal entity. If you do not map legal entities sharing the same ledger
                              to balancing segments, you cannot distinguish them using intercompany
                              functionality or track individual equity.

                                 As the legal employer, you might be required to pay payroll tax, not

                           <p>This example illustrates a more complex configuration.
                              In this enterprise, you define one legal entity, InFusion US as a
                              payroll statutory unit with two separate legal entities, which are
                              also legal employers. This model shows multiple legal employers that
                              are associated with a single payroll statutory unit. Tax reporting
                              units are always associated with a specific legal employer (or employers)
                              through the payroll statutory unit. 
                           </p>
                           <p> The implication is that payroll statutory reporting
                              boundaries vary from human resources (HR) management, and you can
                              categorize the balances separately by one of the following:
                           </p>
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Payroll statutory unit</p>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Legal employer</p>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Tax reporting unit</p>
                              </li>
                              
                           </ul>
                           <p>This configuration is based on tax filing requirements,
                              as some tax-related payments and reports are associated with a higher
                              level than employers. An example of a country that might use this
                              model is the US.

                              and a payroll statutory unit. You define tax reporting units as subsidiaries
                              to the legal entity.

                        <p>A legal employer is a legal entity that employs workers.
                           You define a legal entity as a legal employer in the Oracle Fusion
                           Legal Entity Configurator.

                           Legal employer information for worker assignments is also used for

                        <p>Payroll statutory units are legal entities that are
                           responsible for paying workers, including the payment of payroll tax
                           and social insurance. A payroll statutory unit can pay and report
                           on payroll tax and social insurance on behalf of one or many legal
                           entities, depending on the structure of your enterprise. For example,
                           if you are a multinational, multiple company enterprise, then you
                           register a payroll statutory unit in each country where you employ
                           and pay people. You can optionally register a consolidated payroll
                           statutory unit to pay and report on workers across multiple legal employers within
                           the same country. You associate a legislative data group with a payroll statutory unit to provide the correct payroll information
                           for workers.

                           center represents the smallest segment of an organization for
                           which you collect and report costs. A department is an organization
                           with one or more operational objectives or responsibilities that exist
                           independently of its manager and has one or more workers assigned
                           to it.

                           <p>A cost center represents the destination or
                              function of an expense rather than the nature of the expense which
                              is represented by the natural account. For example, a sales cost center
                              indicates that the expense goes to the sales department.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           
                           <p>A cost center is generally attached to a single legal
                              entity. To identify the cost centers within a chart of accounts structure
                              use one of these two methods:
                           </p>
                           
                           <ul>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Assign a cost center value in the
                                    value set for each cost center. For example, assign cost center values
                                    of PL04 and G3J1 to your manufacturing teams in the US and India.
                                    These unique cost center values allow easy aggregation of cost centers
                                    in hierarchies (trees) even if the cost centers are in different ledgers.
                                    However, this approach requires defining more cost center values.
                                 </p>
                                 
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Assign a balancing segment value
                                    with a standardized cost center value to create a combination of segment
                                    values to represent the cost center. For example, assign the balancing
                                    segment values of 001 and 013 with cost center PL04 to represent your
                                    manufacturing teams in the US and India. This creates 001-PL04 and
                                    013-PL04 as the cost center reporting values. The cost center value
                                    of PL04 has a consistent meaning. This method requires fewer cost
                                    center values to be defined. However, it prevents construction of
                                    cost center hierarchies using trees where only cost center values
                                    are used to report results for a single legal entity. You must specify
                                    a balancing segment value in combination with the cost center values
                                    to report on a single legal entity.

                              and marketing organizations. Sales organization hierarchies are used
                              to report and forecast sales results. Salespeople are defined as resources
                              assigned to these organizations.

                              correspond to sales organizations and hierarchies. Examining the decision

                              possible redundancy in the definition of the organizations is important.

                                 a management hierarchy, in which the System Components Division tracks
                                 its expenses in two cost centers, Air Compressors and Air Transmission.
                                 At the department level, two organizations with a classification of
                                 Department are defined, the Marketing Department and Sales Department.
                                 These two departments can be also identified as a Resource Organizations,
                                 which enable assigning resources, such as salespeople, and other Oracle
                                 Sales Cloud specific information to them. Each department is represented
                                 in the chart of accounts by more than one cost center, enabling granular
                                 as well as hierarchical reporting.

                              to represent a single physical inventory facility or group of inventory
                              storage centers, for example, inventory organizations. This cost organization can roll up to a manager with responsibility
                              for the cost center in the financial reports.

                              departments for developers, quality assurance, and technical writers. 
                           </p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>
                                 <p>Recently, three developers have
                                    left the company.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>The director decides to redirect
                                    the head count to other areas.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>Instead of hiring all three back
                                    into development, one person is hired to each department, quality
                                    assurance, and technical writing.
                                 </p>
                              </li>

                           <p>In software industries, the organization is fluid.
                              Using jobs gives an enterprise the flexibility to determine where
                              to use head count, because the job only exists through the person
                              performing it. In this example, when the three developers leave XYZ
                              Corporation, their jobs no longer exist, therefore the corporation
                              has the flexibility to move the headcount to other areas.
                           </p>
                           <p>This figure illustrates the software industry job

                           percentage for a resource if no override percentage exists for the
                           resource's job. The default target utilization is 100%. The project
                           application administrator can enter a new value in the <span class="uicontrol">Enterprise Target Utilization Percentage</span> field on the Manage Target Utilization Percentages page.

                           for a job. The application uses the percentage override for all resources

                     <p>Also assume that Senior Architects spend half their
                        time on internal activities. To set up the target utilization for
                        Senior Architects, enter 50% as the target utilization override for
                        the job of Senior Architect.

                        assignments compared to their available hours. Oracle Fusion Project
                        Resource Management compares the target utilization percentages with

                        for specific jobs. The override percentage applies to resources with
                        a job title in Oracle Fusion HCM, namely resources who are employees
                        or contingent workers.
