                                 Validates that project resources have a valid allocation percentage.
                                 The resource assignment from and to date are within the project date
                                 range. All of the project resource allocation percentages are greater
                                 than zero and result in assigning the resource for less than or equal
                                 to 24 hours a day. All project resources are assigned valid project
                                 roles.

                                 requests.

                           You use managed project enterprise labor resources to fulfill project
