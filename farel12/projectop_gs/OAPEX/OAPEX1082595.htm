                        you may want to implement as part of an offering. Optional functional
                        areas can be included or excluded from their parent offering. Functional
                        areas may be hierarchical, and therefore may be subordinate to another
                        functional area. An offering has at least one base or core functional
                        area and may have one or more optional functional areas. Additionally,
                        one or more or features may be associated to an offering. Base functional areas indicate the core functionality that you need to implement for the
                        offering to be operational.Optional functional areas indicate optional functionality that you may or may not implement
                        for an offering.

                        <p>Some core functionality essential to an offering
                           such as setting the Initial Users or the Legal Structures may be shared
                           across offerings. These are known as common functional areas and appear
                           across offerings. Although most of the tasks associated to a common
                           functional area are the same regardless of the offering you implement,
                           there may be some offering-specific tasks.

                           area for a given offering, you won't need to repeat its implementation
                           for the remaining offerings, however, it's recommended you check if
                           there is any offering specific tasks that may still require your attention.

                        area to directly implement an entire offering or functional areas
                        within an offering. You do not need to create an implementation project,
                        and instead use a modular approach to your implementation.  You can
                        complete setup of specific business areas quickly to start transactions,
                        and then gradually adopt more and more application functionality as
                        needed.

                     <p>An offering or functional area-based approach means
                        you set up various parts of an offering at different times. You can
                        start with set up of the functional areas that you immediately need
                        to adopt.  Over time, you can continue to set up other functional
                        areas as you start to adopt additional applications functionality.
                        Offerings must be enabled for implementation in order for their functional
                        areas to display. Offering or functional area-based implementation
                        provides the following advantages:

                           <p>When you select an offering the
                              relevant functional areas appear for selection. The common functional
                              areas are those shared across offerings and are listed first. The
                              functional areas that are only associated with the selected offering,
                              are at the bottom of the list.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>A functional area usually has several
                              setup tasks, but only a few of them require input before the application
                              function is ready for transactions.  The rest of the setup tasks are
                              usually optional or have predefined default values based on common
                              use cases. When you select a functional area for implementation, you
                              can view just the required tasks, or you can view the full list of
                              setup tasks for the functional area.

                           and the list of tasks that you need to perform appears.  The tasks
                           are organized with prerequisites and dependencies in mind. Select
                           the task for which you want to enter data and then click Go to Task
                           to render the page where you perform the task.  If the setup data
                           entered through a task can be segmented by a specific attribute, and
                           therefore could be performed iteratively for each qualifying value,
                           then the task may benefit from scope. Typical examples include tasks
                           relevant to legal entities, business units, ledgers, tax regimes,
                           and legislative data roles.  For such tasks, you are prompted to pick
                           a scope value before entering data. You can pick a scope value that
                           was previously selected, select a new scope value, or create a new
                           scope value and then select it. The selected value is a qualifying
                           attribute of the setup data entered by way of the task, and therefore,
                           different setup data can be entered for different scope values. Enter
                           data as appropriate and once you finish, close the page and you return
                           to the functional area list of tasks.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Selecting Offerings</h4>
                        
                        <p>When creating an implementation project you see the
                           list of offerings and functional areas that are configured for implementation.
                           Implementation managers specify which of those offerings and functional
                           areas to include in an implementation project.  It is strongly recommended
                           that you limit your selection to one offering per implementation project,
                           even though the application does not prevent you from including more
                           than one. The implementation manager should decide based on how they
                           plan to manage their implementations. For example, if you implement
                           and deploy different offerings at different times, then having separate
                           implementation projects help to manage the implementation life cycles.
                           Furthermore, the more offerings you included in an implementation
                           project, the bigger the generated task list is. This is because the
                           implementation task list includes all setup tasks needed to implement
                           all included offerings. Alternatively, segmenting into multiple implementation
                           projects makes the process easier to manage and ensures that import
                           and export sequence of the project data is straightforward in the
                           correct sequence.
