                        a research project. You have concerns on the availability of funds

                        collaboration between the award members. You can create a conversation
                        and invite the grants administrator and grants accountant and other
                        members to the award discussion.

                        the suggestions, if any, the grants administrator submits the federal
                        financial report to the sponsor.
