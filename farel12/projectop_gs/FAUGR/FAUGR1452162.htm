                  <p>When you create an award, you define award
                     basic details such as the business unit, legal entity, contract type,
                     primary sponsor, principal investigator, and award date range, which form the award basic details. When
                     you create an award, award, a contract is automatically created in
                     Oracle Fusion Enterprise Contracts.

                     To create a contract, you must be defined as a user
                     in Oracle Fusion Customer Relationship Management who has the Contract
                     Administrator resource role in the business unit of the contract.
                     If you aren't already defined as a user in Customer Relationship Management,
                     then your implementation administrator can identify you as a user
                     and assign the Contract Administrator role to you from the Manage
                     Resources task in the Setup and Maintenance work area.
                     
                  </div>

                     sponsor, and award date range in the award contract in Oracle Fusion

                  <p>When you receive a grant, you can quickly
                     create an award from an award template by using the My Awards card
                     in the Awards work area. When you use this approach, you don't need
                     to go through the detailed process of defining an award, award project,
                     and award funding. The award template lets you create awards that
                     share the common attributes and options from the template.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>When you create an award from the My Awards card,
                     define the key attributes for these award components:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>

                        <p>Award attributes</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Project</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Funding</p>

                        <p>Budget</p>

                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>You don't need to define the other award objects
                     such as keywords, references, attachments, funding sources, organization
                     credits, certifications, terms and conditions, personnel, CFDA, and
                     award descriptive flexfields when you create the award from the My
                     Awards card. These award objects are automatically copied from the
                     award template.
