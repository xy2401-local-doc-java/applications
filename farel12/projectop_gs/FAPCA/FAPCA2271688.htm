                     <p>You can use different types of predefined analytics and reports, or create
                        and edit them, to support your business needs. Oracle Fusion Project
                        Portfolio Management offers predefined analytics and reports across
                        various subject areas. You can use these predefined analytics and reports, or customize
                        them based on your business needs after creating a copy.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can use Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence
                        to create analytics and Oracle Business Intelligence Publisher to
                        create reports.

                        copy.

                  <p>Users with appropriate roles can create and
                     access analyses and reports based on role access to subject areas
                     and catalog folders.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Analyses and reports are secured by applying job
                     roles with associated duty roles to users. Duty role assignments determine
                     access to subject areas for analyses as well as catalog folders. For
                     information about the job and duty roles provided with Oracle Fusion
                     Project Portfolio Management and how to customize your security model
                     by creating custom job roles and assigning duty roles to them, see

                  <p>In addition to folder and object access, duty roles
                     also determine data security. Each of the duty roles that provides
                     access to subject areas and catalog folders is granted one or more
                     data security policies that allow access to the data.
