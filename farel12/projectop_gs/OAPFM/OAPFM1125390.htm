                  <p>Summarization is a systematic organization
                     of information for purposes of project analysis and tracking. You
                     use summarized data to analyze the health of projects and drill down
                     to the causes of any deviation from set thresholds. You can complete
                     the following tasks using summarized data:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Analyze project performance data</p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Review project performance</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Analyze KPI categories and KPIs</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Track project progress</p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>View revenue and invoice summaries</p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>Running summarization renders the KPI related information
                     out of date with respect to the latest summarized information. Therefore,
                     it is important that you generate KPI values after the summarization
                     process completes. You can avoid generating KPI values manually, by
                     enabling automatic generation of KPI values in the summarization options.

                        the following parameters each time you want to run the summarization

                     <p>Performance data summarization collects data from
                        various sources and assigns amounts to relevant tasks and resources
                        in the project. After the process summarizes data, you can view how
                        much is being spent on, incurred by, or received by a task or resource.
                        Also, you can track data across different time lines since the process
                        groups according to periods. Run the <span class="uicontrol">Update

                  <h2>Setting Up the Planning Amount Allocation Basis: Points to Consider</h2>
                  <p>When you set up summarization options, you
                     are required to specify the planning amount allocation basis. You can select a planning
                     amount allocation basis only if you have selected the budgets and
                     forecast data source for summarization. The following are the methods
                     of allocating planning amounts:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>

                  <p>Assume that a project includes a task for
                     team members to undergo some product and soft skills training. A budget
                     of $5900 is allocated to this task between 1 January 2011 and 28 February
                     2011. While summarizing using a monthly accounting calendar, the application
                     can allocate the planned amount in three ways.

                        place. This allocation method could impact period to date cost variance
                        measures for January and February if the actual training costs occur
                        in February. The period start date basis method is the default option.

                     <p>Distribute the budget of $5900 equally over

                              of days the task is active.
                           </p><pre><code>Amount for January 2011 = $100 x 31 = $3100<br></code></pre><pre><code>Amount for February 2011 = $100 x 28 = $2800<br></code></pre></li>

                     <p>Summarizing project performance data using
                        daily proration requires more system resources than summarizing project
                        performance data using the period start or end date basis. To distribute
                        plan amounts evenly across plan duration, the application creates
                        a summarized record for each day for the affected projects and tasks
                        in the project unit.

                     <p>Using the daily proration basis method reduces
