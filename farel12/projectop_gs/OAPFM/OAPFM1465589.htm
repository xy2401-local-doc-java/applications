                        Plan your document sequencing carefully before you
                        start applying sequence numbers. Avoid switching to a different mode
                        after you saved your work on the Manage Document Sequences and Manage
                        Document Sequence Categories pages.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Automatic Sequencing</h4>
                        
                        <p>Automatic document sequencing assigns a unique number
                           to each document automatically when the document is generated. That
                           unique number is stored in the database. You can set an initial value
                           for the numbering sequence. Thereafter, the numbering is sequential
                           by date and time of creation. If you don't provide an initial value,
                           the application sets the default initial value as 1.
                        </p>
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="sect3" id="OAPFM173809">
                        <h4 class="topictitle">Manual Sequencing </h4>
                        
                        <p>Use the manual sequencing mode to assign a unique
                           number to each document before the document is generated. In manual
                           sequencing, the numeric ordering and completeness of a transaction
                           is not automatically enforced. As a result, users can skip or omit
                           numbers when entering the sequence value. However, each time a user
                           assigns a number, the application validates its uniqueness.
                        </p>
                        
                     </div>

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Gapless Sequencing</h4>
                        
                        <p>Gapless sequencing is similar to automatic sequencing.
                           It automatically generates a unique number for each document, but
                           does that only for successfully generated documents. Sequence numbers
                           are not assigned to incomplete or failed documents. As a result, the
                           sequence is maintained for all the successfully generated documents.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Additionally, you can control the gapless document
                           sequencing by enforcing the Transaction Date Validation option. When
                           enabled, this option checks for the transaction date of a particular
                           document and assigns the sequence number accordingly, to chronologically
                           maintain the documents. The sequence numbers and the transaction dates
                           are chronologically correlated to prevent any mismatch of a new document
                           sequence being assigned to an older document or vice versa.
                        </p>

                           Use this type of sequencing only if necessary because
                           it may affect the performance of the application and slow down transaction
                           processing.

                     <p>A document sequence category is a set of documents
                        that share similar characteristics and that are formed into a logical
                        group. Document sequence categories simplify the task of assigning
                        number sequences to specific documents. Instead of assigning a number
                        to each document, you assign a document sequence to one or
                        more document sequence categories. The document sequence category
                        automatically takes care of numbering the documents. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A document sequence category identifies the database
                        table that stores documents resulting from transactions that your
                        users enter. When you assign a sequence to a category, the sequence
                        numbers the documents that are stored in a particular table. You must
                        create document sequence categories to be able to manage the task
                        of assigning document sequences. 
                     </p>

                        Once a document sequence category is created, you
                        can't change the application, the category code, or the table name.
                        Therefore, carefully consider these details and plan your document
                        sequencing requirement before you begin working with the application.

                     <p>Once you create a document sequence category, it is
                        available for use under the <span class="uicontrol">Document Sequences:

                        The <span class="uicontrol">Category</span> field contains the
                        name of the document sequence category. After you create a document
                        sequence, you can assign it to a document sequence category.

                        Products that implement document sequencing have specifications
                        about its usage. Refer to the corresponding product documentation
                        for specific details and also to determine if there are any restrictions
                        or configuration prerequisites.

                           requirement. By default, the current date is considered as the start
                           date. The sequence definition never expires if you don't provide an
                           end date. Among the several options used in creating and editing document
                           sequences, the following options are functionally more important and

                        <h4>Can I create a contract for intercompany billing with transfer price rules?</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Yes, but only if you derive rates for an intercompany
                           contract based on an organization hierarchy structure instead of the
                           bill rates defined on a bill plan. The contract line and bill plan
                           architecture allows you to specify a different bill plan for each
                           provider and receiver organization. Select a bill rate or burden rate
                           schedule for each of your contract bill plans. However, if your rates
                           are defined at a granular level, you may need to derive rates for
                           an organization hierarchy structure using transfer price rules.

                        <h4>Why can't I see the internal billing details on a contract?</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>If you do not see the internal billing features
                           on a contract, check the attributes on the contract type. The internal
                           billing options of a contract are only visible if the contract type
                           is designated as either intercompany or interproject.
