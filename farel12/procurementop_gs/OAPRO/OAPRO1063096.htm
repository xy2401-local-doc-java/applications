                  <p>Offerings are application solution sets representing
                     one or more business processes and activities that you typically provision
                     and implement as a unit. They are, therefore, the primary drivers
                     of functional setup of Oracle Fusion applications. Some of the examples
                     of offerings are Financials, Procurement, Sales, Marketing, Order
                     Orchestration, and Workforce Deployment. An offering is the highest
                     level grouping of Oracle Fusion Applications functionality. They include
                     functional areas, and alternative business rules known as features.

                  <p>A functional area is a grouping of functionality
                     within an offering. It may be an optional piece of functionality that
                     you may want to implement as part of an offering. Optional functional
                     areas can be included or excluded from their parent offering. Functional
                     areas may be hierarchical, and therefore may be subordinate to another
                     functional area. An offering has at least one base or core functional
                     area and may have one or more optional functional areas. Additionally,
                     one or more or features may be associated to an offering. Base functional areas indicate the core functionality that you need to implement for the
                     offering to be operational.Optional functional areas indicate optional functionality that you may or may not implement
                     for an offering.

                     <p>Some core functionality essential to an offering
                        such as setting the Initial Users or the Legal Structures may be shared
                        across offerings. These are known as common functional areas and appear
                        across offerings. Although most of the tasks associated to a common
                        functional area are the same regardless of the offering you implement,
                        there may be some offering-specific tasks.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>In general once you implement a common functional
                        area for a given offering, you won't need to repeat its implementation
                        for the remaining offerings, however, it's recommended you check if
                        there is any offering specific tasks that may still require your attention.

                        for an offering are known as base functional areas and must be implemented in order for the offering to be operational.
                        Other functional areas known as optional functional areas support processes or functionality that can be implemented at your
                        discretion depending on the business requirements. These can be implemented
                        later during the implementation process.

                  <p>Once you make offering and functional area
                     selections, Oracle Fusion Functional Setup Manager creates the implementation
                     project and generates a complete list of setup tasks based upon your
                     selections. The predefined hierarchical task list added when you select
                     an offering is called the offering top task list. It includes a complete
                     list of all tasks, including the prerequisites required to implement
                     the offering. Typically, this task list has the same name as the name
                     of the offering it represents. If multiple offerings are included
                     in a single implementation project, then each one of the offering
                     top task lists shows as a top node in the implementation task list
                     hierarchy.

                        excluded from the task list. The implementation task list is generated
                        according to the offering configurations and top task list definitions
                        present at the time an implementation project is created. Once created,
                        the task list in the implementation project becomes self-contained
                        and does not change based on any changes made to the offering configurations
                        or top task list definitions.

                        the recommended state. Different implementations may select to implement
                        the offerings in different orders. A predecessor task may also be
                        a common task for many different offerings. If a predecessor task

                        The predecessor and the dependent tasks might be performed in parallel
                        by entering certain values of predecessor first and then followed
                        by entering the data that is dependent on the already entered parent
                        data, and then repeating the process for each step of the data dependency.

                  <p>When planning your implementation, you decide
                     what business processes your organization or company performs or supports.
                     These decisions determine the offerings and functional areas you want
                     to implement. You then configure the offerings and functional areas
                     that support the activities your organization or company performs.
                     During the configuration process, you specifically enable offerings
                     and functional areas for use before you implement them.

                     <p>Use the Setup and Maintenance work area to
                        help decide which offerings to enable for implementation. Once you
                        decide to use an offering, you can select the Configure button to
                        choose the configuration details and enable the offering, associated
                        functional areas, and features. All the base functional areas of an
                        offering are automatically enabled for implementation when you enable
                        the parent offering. You choose which optional functional areas to
                        enable. The functional areas appear in an expandable and collapsible
                        hierarchy to facilitate progressive decision making for implementation.

                        rules or methods used to fine-tune business processes and activities
                        supported by an offering or a functional area. If features are available
                        for the offering or functional areas, you can enable them to help
                        meet your business requirements, if desired. In general, the features
                        are set with a default configuration based on their typical usage
                        in most implementations. You should always review the available features
                        for the offering and functional areas and select them as appropriate.
                        Dependent features appear visible when the feature choice they depend
                        on is selected for implementation.

                     and instead use a modular approach to your implementation.  You can
                     complete setup of specific business areas quickly to start transactions,
                     and then gradually adopt more and more application functionality as

                  <p>An offering or functional area-based approach means
                     you set up various parts of an offering at different times. You can
                     start with set up of the functional areas that you immediately need
                     to adopt.  Over time, you can continue to set up other functional
                     areas as you start to adopt additional applications functionality.
                     Offerings must be enabled for implementation in order for their functional
                     areas to display. Offering or functional area-based implementation
                     provides the following advantages:

                           relevant functional areas appear for selection. The common functional
                           areas are those shared across offerings and are listed first. The
                           functional areas that are only associated with the selected offering,
                           are at the bottom of the list.

                     <li>
                        <p>A functional area usually has several
                           setup tasks, but only a few of them require input before the application
                           function is ready for transactions.  The rest of the setup tasks are
                           usually optional or have predefined default values based on common
                           use cases. When you select a functional area for implementation, you
                           can view just the required tasks, or you can view the full list of
                           setup tasks for the functional area.

                     <p>You select the functional area you want to implement
                        and the list of tasks that you need to perform appears.  The tasks
                        are organized with prerequisites and dependencies in mind. Select
                        the task for which you want to enter data and then click Go to Task
                        to render the page where you perform the task.  If the setup data
                        entered through a task can be segmented by a specific attribute, and
                        therefore could be performed iteratively for each qualifying value,
                        then the task may benefit from scope. Typical examples include tasks
                        relevant to legal entities, business units, ledgers, tax regimes,
                        and legislative data roles.  For such tasks, you are prompted to pick
                        a scope value before entering data. You can pick a scope value that
                        was previously selected, select a new scope value, or create a new
                        scope value and then select it. The selected value is a qualifying
                        attribute of the setup data entered by way of the task, and therefore,
                        different setup data can be entered for different scope values. Enter
                        data as appropriate and once you finish, close the page and you return
                        to the functional area list of tasks.

                  <p>You can create implementation projects to
                     manage the implementation of an offering and functional areas as a
                     unit throughout the implementation life cycle, or maintain the setup
                     of specific business processes and activities customizing the list
                     of tasks to complete their implementation.

                  <p>An implementation project is the list of setup tasks
                     you need to complete to implement selected offerings and functional
                     areas. You create a project either by:

                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>selecting an offering and its functional
                           areas you want to implement together, then customize the list of tasks
                           for such offering and functional areas as applicable.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>selecting specific setup task lists
                           and tasks you require for a specific configuration.
                        </p>
                     </li>

                  <p>You can also assign these tasks to users and track
                     their completion using the included project management tools.

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Selecting Offerings</h3>
                     
                     <p>When creating an implementation project you see the
                        list of offerings and functional areas that are configured for implementation.
                        Implementation managers specify which of those offerings and functional
                        areas to include in an implementation project.  It is strongly recommended
                        that you limit your selection to one offering per implementation project,
                        even though the application does not prevent you from including more
                        than one. The implementation manager should decide based on how they
                        plan to manage their implementations. For example, if you implement
                        and deploy different offerings at different times, then having separate
                        implementation projects help to manage the implementation life cycles.
                        Furthermore, the more offerings you included in an implementation
                        project, the bigger the generated task list is. This is because the
                        implementation task list includes all setup tasks needed to implement
                        all included offerings. Alternatively, segmenting into multiple implementation
                        projects makes the process easier to manage and ensures that import
                        and export sequence of the project data is straightforward in the
                        correct sequence.
