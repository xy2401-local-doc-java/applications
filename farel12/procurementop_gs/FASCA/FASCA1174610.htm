      a comprehensive offering for standardizing corporate contract policies, improving internal controls, and complying with all
      contractual obligations and regulatory requirements. The key features of Oracle Enterprise Contracts include the following:
      With Oracle Enterprise Contracts, companies can implement contract best practices with standard templates, clauses, and contract
      policy rules that can be enforced enterprise wide. Global organizations can establish company-wide standards that can be adopted
      and tailored by regional administrators to comply with local or country-specific regulations. The Contract Expert feature
      guides users through a questionnaire. Based on the user's responses and other negotiated business terms, such as products,
      prices, and contract amount, Contract Expert adds any required clauses. Standards-based contracts can be generated, reviewed,
      and approved with little or no legal supervision. Users can print the contract as a PDF document for signature. The application
      also enforces contract policy controls to prevent unauthorized modifications. Contract collaboration and negotiation is streamlined
      using the two-way integration with Microsoft Word. The change tracking in Microsoft Word enables the contract administrator,
      legal department, or the external party to make changes offline. The document is synchronized with the structured contract
      terms stored in the application. A single view of all enterprise contracts is essential for effective management of contract
      activities and for reporting and analysis of outstanding supplier, customer, and partner commitments. Contracts enables contract
      professionals to search and view all contracts from a single location. The text-based search engine can combine keyword searches
      with structured information like contract dates or amounts. Thus providing unprecedented access to contracts for all key stakeholders.
      The Contracts Dashboard provides a snapshot of all contracts-related activities, including deliverables progress, approvals,
      and contracts that need attention. If you're creating a contract without project information, you can select a business unit
      that has no assigned ledger or legal entity. To enable autonumbering for such a contract, you must enable the contract type
      for the different global numbering levels and business unit. In this case, the numbering levels of the ledger and the legal
      entity are don't apply. In addition, you must have created document sequences for the document categories of the global and
      business unit."><script>window.ohcglobal || document.write('<script src="/en/dcommon/js/global.js">\x3C/script>')</script></head>

                     <p>With Oracle Enterprise Contracts, companies
                        can implement contract best practices with standard templates, clauses,
                        and contract policy rules that can be enforced enterprise wide.  Global
                        organizations can establish company-wide standards that can be adopted
                        and tailored by regional administrators to comply with local or country-specific
                        regulations.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Contract administrators and legal personnel may author
                        and negotiate many complex contracts each year. Oracle Enterprise
                        Contracts simplifies the process by allowing contract administrators
                        to maintain a central library of standard clauses, contract templates,
                        and policy rules across the enterprise. Contract templates enable
                        rapid assembly and creation of contracts by providing standard contract
                        boilerplate language for each type of sale or procurement. Policy
                        rules specify which clauses are mandatory for a contract or protected
                        against updates during negotiation.

                     <p> The Contract Expert feature guides users
                        through a questionnaire. Based on the user's responses and other negotiated
                        business terms, such as products, prices, and contract amount, Contract

                        generated, reviewed, and approved with little or no legal supervision.
                        Users can print the contract as a PDF document for signature. The
                        application also enforces contract policy controls to prevent unauthorized
                        modifications. Contract collaboration and negotiation is streamlined
                        using the two-way integration with Microsoft Word. The change tracking

                        or the external party to make changes offline. The document is synchronized

                        approval also triggers the same validation process. You must fix all
                        errors for the contract to pass validation. Resolving warnings is
                        optional.

                  <p>A contract typically moves through a variety
                     of states throughout its life cycle, from initial drafting to negotiation
                     to active management and eventually to contract closeout. A contract
                     status indicates where a contract is in its life cycle, and also determines
                     what actions and operations are permitted for the contract.

                  <p>The Contract Wizard guided process is based on the
                     origin of the contract terms. If the contract terms originate internally
                     in your organization, then you add the contract terms by applying
                     a contract
                     terms template. If the contract terms originate from an external
                     party such as a supplier, then you upload the file containing the
                     contract terms because the contract terms are authored outside the
                     application.

                              the template or let you select one of your own.

                     <p>To create the contract, you select the contract type
                        and enter basic contract information, including the contract party

                     <p>If the Authoring Party is Internal, depending on the
                        setup, the application recommends a contract terms template or lets
                        you select one of your own. You can preview templates by clicking
                        the Preview Contract button. The preview does not appear in the same
                        format as the final contract and does not include the clauses that
                        may be inserted by the application in later steps.

                        the values in the contract and may use them to determine if additional
                        clauses are required. This step is the equivalent to entering variable
                        values using the Editing Variable Values action or running the Contract Expert feature
                        during authoring without the wizard.

                        can search for enterprise contracts: either by using contract attributes,
                        or by searching for specific words or phrases in the text of the contract's

                        You cannot create a new version once a contract is

                        is signed and active, if you still need to make changes, you can amend
                        the contract. Amending a contract creates a new version of the contract
                        in Under Amendment status.

                        Contracts work area provides several ways to create a contract template. The following

                        <p>Duplicating an Existing Contract Template</p>
                        <p>You can duplicate a contract template from an existing
                           contract template. The duplicate template will be for the same business
                           unit, legal entity, contract type, and currency as the original template.
                           In addition, you can choose to retain party and line information from
                           the existing contract template. 
                        </p>
                        <p>To duplicate an existing contract template, select
                           the Duplicate action either from within an existing contract template
                           on the Edit Contract Template page or from the Contract Template search
                           area on the Manage Contract Templates page. The contract template
                           that you are duplicating can be in Draft, Active, or Expired status.
                           Specify the new template number in the Duplicate Contract Template
                           window. This action creates a new contract template in Draft status.

                           Specify the business unit, legal entity, contract type, template number,
                           and currency on the Create Contract Template window. To create contract
                           templates with lines and line items, you must have selected the required
                           item master. This action creates a new contract template in Draft
                           status for which you can perform the following tasks:

                           the contract, the item master is copied over to the contract template
                           from the contract. You can then edit most of these attributes on the
                           template; the exceptions are business unit, legal entity and contract
                           type.

                        and the contract template expiration date is reached, the application
                        automatically changes the contract template status to Expired. When

                        only in the History tab.

                     <h3>What's the difference between a contract template and a contract terms template?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A contract template is like a
                        contract.  The contract template provides a boilerplate for common
                        contract attributes that the organization can use in creating multiple
                        contracts quickly. For example, a contract template can help create
                        multiple contracts for a particular customer, or multiple contracts
                        with the same contract line information for different customers. However,
                        a contract template has no fulfillment lines, terms, or financial
                        summary. You can make the contract template available for use by activating
                        it directly after you create it without validation or approval. In
                        addition, you cannot close a contract template or place it on hold.
                        Just as you amend an active contract to make changes to it, so you
                        must revise an active contract template to make changes to the template.
                        Revising a contract template creates a new version of the template
                        in Draft status.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You create acontract terms template in the Terms Library. The terms template is a boilerplate for contract
                        terms and conditions relevant to the business of the contract. This
                        includes standard clauses and sections that are applied to the contract
                        using the template selection default rules that you set up. However,
                        before a terms template can be used to apply terms to a contract,
                        the terms template must clear the automated validation check and must
                        be approved by the contract terms author. You can place contract terms
                        templates on hold and edit, revise, approve and reject terms templates.
                        If you need to make changes after the template is approved and in
                        use, you can create a new version of the terms template and submitting
                        it for approval. The revision once approved, automatically replaces
                        the current version in the Terms Library. The application does not
                        save previous versions of templates.

                     <p>You might not be able to create a contract

                              that does not permit this action. For instance, it is in Draft status
                              pending activation or it has expired.

                           <p>The contract template might be
                              an active template that is under revision which means a newer version
                              of the template is in Draft status pending activation. When you are
                              creating a contract from a template, the application uses the latest
                              active version of the template.
