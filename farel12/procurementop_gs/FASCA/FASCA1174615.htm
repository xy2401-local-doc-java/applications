                  <p>Contract fulfillment makes
                     it possible for you to track goods, services, reports and other fulfillment
                     items you are purchasing in buy-intent contracts. Depending on the
                     type of contract you are creating, you can use contract fulfillment
                     to initiate the creation purchase orders or purchase agreements within
                     Oracle Fusion Purchasing or in other integrated purchasing applications
                     and monitor their fulfillment from within the contract. This topic
                     explains how you create and work with contract fulfillment.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The figure below illustrates how you can create and
                     work with both contractual and noncontractual fulfillment
                     lines and how you can initiate purchasing activity from those fulfillment
                     lines:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ol>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>You can create a fulfillment either
                           on the contract header or on individual contract lines by selecting
                           either the <span class="uicontrol">Autocreate Fulfillment Lines</span> or the <span class="uicontrol">Create fulfillment</span> actions.
                           The Autocreate Fulfillment Lines action creates the fulfillment line
                           and copies the contract basic header or contract line information
                           to the fulfillment line so you do not have to enter it manually.
                        </p>
                        <p>Selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Autocreate Fulfillment
                              Lines</span> action from the header automatically creates one
                           fulfillment line per contract line. If there are no contract lines,
                           then the application creates one fulfillment based on the header details
                           provided the contract
                           type is of class Purchase Agreement. You cannot autocreate
                           fulfillment lines for contracts without contract lines if the contract
                           type class is Enterprise Contract.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Review the notifications that are
                           sent automatically to interested parties regarding fulfillment progress
                           and deadlines. The contract type can be set up to automatically specify
                           who gets notified and when. You can change and add additional notifications
                           for the contract.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>If you are using the fulfillment
                           to initiate the purchase of goods and services using the integrated
                           purchasing applications, then you must enter the required purchasing
                           details. For autocreated fulfillment, these details are copied automatically
                           from the corresponding contract lines.
                        </p>

                     <li>
                        <p>When the contract is approved and
                           becomes active, you can initiate the creation of the purchasing documents
                           in one of the purchasing applications. When you do, the application
                           validates the information you entered to make sure it meets all the
                           requirements of the purchasing application and creates the purchasing
                           document. If it does not you must edit the fulfillment to enter additional
                           information.
                        </p>

                           If the contract goes into amendment after being approved,
                           you cannot create any further fulfillment lines or edit existing ones.
                           If you initiated the creation of purchasing documents when the contract
                           became active, you can still continue to execute the fulfillments
                           on the purchasing document. In the event that you did not initiate
                           a purchasing document for the approved contract before it went into
                           amendment, you can create one based on the latest active version of
                           the contract and treat this as an active contract on which you can
                           execute existing fulfillment lines.

                           of its execution.

                        the information entered in the contract, then you can select the <span class="uicontrol">Autocreate Fulfillment Lines</span> action to create
                        a fulfillment line in either the contract Header tab or the Lines
                        tab. Using Autocreate Fulfillment Lines on the contract header creates
                        a single fulfillment line for each contract line. On the Lines tab,
                        you can select individual contract lines where you want to create

                        You can create multiple fulfillment lines for a single
                        contract line if you need the fulfillment line items to be shipped
                        to different destinations, for example. This is accomplished by autocreating
                        a fulfillment line, duplicating it, and then editing the fulfillment
                        line information.

                     <p>Before you initiate the purchasing document by selecting
                        either the <span class="uicontrol">Create Purchase Order</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Create Purchase Agreement</span> actions, you must enter all purchasing information required by the
                        purchasing document you are creating and wait until the contract is
                        approved.

                     <p>You can create one purchase document from multiple

                        lines created from contract lines when creating a purchase order,
                        creates one PO with lines corresponding to each of the fulfillment

                        document is successfully created when the fulfillment status changes
                        to the <span class="uicontrol">PO Created</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Agreement Created</span> status.

                     <p>You can create two types of contract fulfillment:</p>
                     
                     
                     <ul>

                           <p>Fulfillment
                              lines that are covered by the terms of the contract. You can initiate
                              standard purchase orders or purchase agreements from contractual fulfillment
                              lines, depending on the purpose of the contract.

                           <p>Noncontractual</p>
                           <p>Fulfillment lines that aren't negotiated as part of the contract,
                              which are used to monitor the progress or quality of contractual fulfillment
                              lines. You can also create purchase orders and purchase agreements
                              from noncontractual fulfillment lines.
                           </p>

                     <p>A contract fulfillment of either type can have one
                        or two directions:
                     </p>

                           <p>The fulfillment
                              is the responsibility of the external party, such as the supplier

                  <p>To create purchase orders and agreements in

                        However, you must run Import Blanket Agreements to create blanket purchase
                        agreements and Import Contract Agreements to create blanket contract
                        agreements. You can run these processes from the Purchasing
                        work area, by selecting the appropriate task under the Agreements
                        heading. You can schedule these processes to run periodically, depending
