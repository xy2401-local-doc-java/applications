                  <p>This topic provides an overview of contract
                     terms authoring on the Contract Terms tab when you create or edit
                     the contract by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Create Contract</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Edit Contract</span> tasks in the
                     Manage Contracts page or the Contracts work area.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>Just what actions you can take during contract terms
                     authoring depends on your implementation, your privileges, and contract
                     type. Some contracts may have their contract terms already populated
                     from a contract
                     terms template and permit you only to add and delete clauses
                     from the Contract
                     Terms Library. Other contracts may allow you to create nonstandard clauses or require you to answer questions to determine if additional clauses
                     are required. For some contracts, you may attach the contract terms
                     in a separate document and not use the authoring capabilities of the
                     application at all.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p> 
                     <p>The following diagram outlines the
                        contract terms authoring process:
                     </p> 
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>If the contract terms are not applied
                              in the Contract Terms tab, then you must add them either by selecting
                              a contract terms template or by attaching the contract terms in a
                              file. Choosing a contract terms template populates the tab with the
                              contract terms from that template and permits you to edit them in
                              the application. If you choose to attach the contract terms as a document,
                              then you must continue to work outside the application.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Some contract terms templates require
                              you to run the Contract
                              Expert feature and enter additional information to determine
                              if more clauses are required.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>You can edit the contract terms either
                              in the application or outside the application using Microsoft Word
                              2007.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>You must enter any missing values for
                              variables.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Optionally, you can change the contract
                              terms source, either switching to a different contract terms template
                              or attaching the terms in a document. Alternately, you can remove
                              all of the contract terms completely.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>You can also check for any clause updates
                              in the Contract Terms Library.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>You can run a report detailing the
                              changes you made to the contract terms applied from a template and
                              have the deviations report submitted for approval along with the contract.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>The last step before submitting the
                              contract for approval is to validate your contract terms and eliminate
                              any errors.
                           </p>

                     <h3 class="topictitle">Specifying the Source of Contract Terms</h3>
                     
                     <p>The first step in the contract terms authoring process
                        is to specify the source of your contract terms. The contract source
                        can be either a contract terms template or an external document.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In some contracts, the contract terms are applied automatically
                        from contract terms templates based on rules set up by the Contract
                        Terms Library administrator. In other contracts, you must add the
                        contract terms yourself. You can either accept the template recommended
                        by the application, choose a different template, or attach the contract
                        terms in a separate document.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Depending on your permissions, you can change the
                        source of the contract terms at any time during the authoring process
                        by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Change Contract Source</span> action.
                     </p>
                     
                  </div>
                  
                  <div class="sect2" id="FASCA55467">
                     <h3 class="topictitle">Running Contract Expert</h3>
                     
                     <p>Some contract terms templates require you to run the
                        Contract Expert feature to determine whether additional clauses must
                        be added. You can tell if you must run Contract Expert when the Clauses
                        tab includes the Contract Expert Last Run indicator above the contract
                        terms preview region. When you run Contract Expert by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Run Contract Expert</span> action, Contract Expert
                        may ask you to enter values for contract variables and to answer questions.
                        If you don't run Contract Expert on a contract that requires it, then
                        you receive a warning message during contract validation.
                     </p>

                     <p>Depending on the contract , you can, add, move, and
                        delete clauses and sections. For example, you can add standard clauses, substitute alternate clauses for existing clauses, edit standard clauses or create nonstandard clauses that are specific to the contract.

                     <p>Switching templates by applying a different
                        template removes all of the contract terms applied from the old template,
                        including any that you may have edited and changed into nonstandard clauses. The application moves any standard clauses you added or any nonstandard
                        clauses you created from scratch to the Unassigned section. The Unassigned
                        section, which is created automatically, doesn't appear in the printed
                        contract. You must move any clauses from the Unassigned section to
                        other sections if you want them to be part of the new contract terms.

                  <p>If a Contract Expert-enabled contract
                     terms template is applied to your contract, then you must run Contract
                     Expert to determine if the contract deviates from company policies
                     or if any additional clauses are required. When you run Contract Expert,
                     you may be asked to enter values for contract variables or to answer
                     questions . Based on your responses, Contract Expert may suggest additional
                     clauses from the Terms Library for insertion into the contract terms.
                     If you fail to run Contract Expert on a contract which requires it,
                     then you will receive a warning when you attempt to submit the contract
                     for approval or when you download the contract for editing in Word
                     2007 or later versions. You can run Contract Expert at that time.

                              questions. If you already ran Contract Expert on the contract before,

                     <p>You can add clauses in one of two ways:</p>
                     
                     <ul>

                              Library directly into a section in the template. 
                           </p>
                           <p>You can create the clause in the library from the template if the
                              library does not have what you need.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Create Contract Expert rules to add
                              clauses to the contract terms in a contract depending on the specifics
                              of the contract.

                     <p>For example, you may want to add a boilerplate jurisdiction
                        clause directly into the template, but use a Contract Expert rule
                        to insert the appropriate liability clause. This way a contract that
                        calls for the shipment of hazardous materials will get a liability
                        clause that's different from a contract that does not include any,
                        for example.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The properties that you set up in the clause apply
                        automatically. If you set up a clause as mandatory, you will not be
                        able to delete the clause after it is inserted by the template unless
                        you have the special Override Contract Terms and Conditions Controls
                        privilege. If you set up a clause with alternates, then you can substitute
                        any of the alternate clauses in the contract. 
                     </p>

                        Terms Template pages. When Contract Expert rules enabled for the template
                        suggest additional clauses, these additional clauses are presented
                        for your review before they are inserted in the default section specified
                        in each clause. Depending on privileges, you can choose which clauses
                        to insert and which to omit. If you make Contract Expert suggestions
                        mandatory for the template, then you can reject the recommendations
                        only if you have the special Override Contract Terms and Conditions

                     <p>While editing the contract terms template, you specify
                        a template to be the default for a contract type or document type
                        in the Document Types region. You can set up only one template as
                        the default for each contract type or document type. You set up the
                        Contract Expert template selection rules separately as described in
                        a related topic. You can have multiple rules recommend the same template.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Here is how the defaults you enter in the Document
                        Types region and the Contract Expert template selection rules interact
                        to select and apply a template during contract authoring:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Contract Expert template selection
                              rules always take priority. If the rules specify a single template
                              for a contract, then it gets applied regardless of the default you
                              entered in the Document Type region.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>If the Contract Expert rules recommend
                              different templates, then the application uses the default from the
                              Document Type region as a tiebreaker.
                           </p>

                              applies and you specified a default, then the application uses the
                              default.

                              default for a contact type or document type, then you must select
                              the template from a list while authoring.

                  <p>For a contract terms template to be available for use by contract authors, it must pass an automatic
                     validation check and be approved by the contract terms administrator.
                     If you need to make changes after the template is approved and in
                     use, you can create a new version by editing the approved template
                     and submitting it for approval. After the revision is approved, it
                     replaces the original automatically.

                        Stop Approval action on the Edit Terms Template page to do so. Stopping
                        terms template approval, automatically stops the approval of clauses
                        that you created or added and submitted for approval with the terms

                        to their previous Draft status. For clauses in Pending Approval status
                        that you added to the terms template from the Terms Library, stopping
                        the approval of the terms template has no effect on these clauses.
                        These clauses remain in their Terms Library statuses.

                                 as sections or clause titles, depending on their style. If you insert
                                 a heading with the <span class="uicontrol">ClauseTitle2</span> style applied and that is followed by text with the <span class="uicontrol">Normal</span> style applied, then the heading is
                                 imported as a clause title and the text as the clause text. If you
                                 enter a heading with the <span class="uicontrol">Heading1</span> style, then it will become a section.

                                 heading, then the application automatically creates a clause title
                                 with a clause number based on the number of such clauses without titles.
                                 The first title is Clause 1 and the title of the ninth such clause
                                 is Clause 9.

                           moving clauses or sections within the contract terms. Font changes
                           are only imported if they are accompanied with another edit. For example,
                           the application will ignore clause text you placed in italics if that
                           is the only edit you made. Nor does the application import any edits
                           you may make to the clause or section numbers. It retains the numbering
                           in the structured terms.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Also not imported are any changes in variable values
                           you made in the Word document. You must edit the variable values in
                           the application after your upload.

                           accidentally. If you want to reject individual changes, then you must
                           cancel the upload, make additional edits to the Word document, and
                           upload again.

                        the contractual terms associated with a contract directly from the
                        terms library. Within Microsoft Word you can search and add clauses
                        or sections from the library to your contract. You can also perform
                        other modifications such as adding, modifying or deleting existing
                        sections, clauses, and variables.

                     <p>You can add sections and clauses to a contract terms
                        template on the <span class="uicontrol">Clauses</span> tab while editing the template. Alternately, you can set up Contract Expert rules
                        to suggest clauses based on the circumstances of each contract.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Use the outline region on the left of the Clauses
                        tab to add sections and clauses that will be present in all contracts
                        created with the template. You must add at least one section using
                        the Actions menu before you can add clauses. If you do not find the
                        clause you need while adding clauses, you can create one from the
                        Add Clauses window. You must refresh the preview of your template
                        by clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Refresh</span> icon on
                        the right side of the tab to see your latest edits.

                     <p>Also, you can create rules to add clauses that vary
                        contract to contract. Contract Expert can add clauses based on variable
                        values and answers to questions contract authors supply when they
                        author the contract.

                        template, the application ignores the document type default you specify
                        here. However, should the Contract Expert rules you set up pick multiple
                        templates, then the application uses the document type default you
                        set here as a tiebreaker.

                        template that only prints the summary of amendments made to contract
                        terms or a terms layout template that prints both the amendment summary
                        and the amended contract terms and conditions. You can also configure
                        the printing options available on the page when creating and editing

                     <p>If you are creating a contract terms template and a clause you want to add does not exist in the Contract Terms Library, then you can quickly create the missing clause by clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Create Clause</span> button. Creating a clause in
                        this way automatically associates it to the terms template. While
                        this abbreviated creation method does not permit the entry of some
                        details, including clause instructions, references, and relationships
                        to other clauses, you can always add any missing information later
                        by editing the clause.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Creating clauses in this way also enables you to
                        submit them for approval all at one go along with the terms template.
                        Otherwise, you would have to create each clause using the Create Clause
                        task and submit each one in turn for approval.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>  Similarly, withdrawing the terms template from
                        approval, stops approval of all the draft clauses submitted for approval
                        with the terms template. This includes draft clauses that you added
                        from the Terms Library. On stopping approval these draft clauses revert
                        from their Pending Approval status to Draft status. Clauses in Pending
                        Approval status that you added to the terms template from the Terms
                        Library stay in their Terms Library statuses when you withdraw the
                        terms template from approval.

                     <p>If you submitted a single draft clause for
                        approval from the Edit Clause page, then you can stop approval of
                        this clause from the same page. If you submitted a draft clause along
                        with several other draft clauses for approval with a terms template,
                        then you cannot stop the approval of this clause using the Stop Approval
                        action from the Edit Clause page. In such a case, you must withdraw
                        the terms template from approval using the Stop Approval action on
                        the Edit Terms Template page. This stops approval of all draft clauses
                        submitted for approval with the terms template and reverts their status
                        from Pending Approval back to Draft status. If the terms template
                        submitted for approval also has clauses in Pending Approval status
                        and Approved status, then stopping terms template approval has no
                        effect.  These clauses remain as approved and pending approval clauses
                        in the Terms Library.

                     <p>For clauses in the process of localization that you
                        withdraw from approval, in addition to the status of the clause being
                        reverted, the adoption type is also reset to the previous Available
                        for Adoption value.

                        Stopping approval of a clause does not remove it
                        from use. The clause is available as a draft clause in the Terms Library.

                        the Stop Approval action is no longer available. Once a terms template
                        is approved, all draft clauses on the terms template are also approved.
                        After a clause is approved, you can delete it, put it on hold, or
                        enter an end date on the clause if you want to remove it from use.

                        If the terms template is approved, then all draft
                        clauses automatically become approved. Clauses in Pending Approval
                        status stay in the same status till you approve these clauses individually

                     <p>You can also make all clauses inserted by Contract Expert rules

                        This will make any clauses recommended by Contract Expert mandatory
                        for the contract.

                     <p>The clause default section is the contract
                        terms section where the Contract Expert rules generally insert the clause. To specify
                        the location of an expert suggested clause in relation to the other
                        clauses, you may mark that clause as a conditional clause and then
                        add it in the required location in the terms template associated with
                        the business document. The location of the clause in the terms template
                        takes precedence over the clause's default section when expert suggested
                        clauses are inserted into the business document.

                     <p>If you are using a Contract Expert rule to
                        insert clauses into a contract, then Contract Expert inserts the clause
                        in the location that is predefined for the clause in the terms template.
                        If the clause location is not defined in the terms template, then
                        Contract Expert inserts the clause into the section that is specified
                        in the Default Section field in the General Information region on
                        the create and edit clause pages. If you do not specify a default
                        section for the clause, then Contract Expert uses the default section
                        specified in the Contract Expert region on the General tab in the
                        create and edit contract terms template pages. If the section doesn't
                        already exist in the contract where the clause is being inserted,
                        Contract Expert adds the section along with the clause.

                     <p>Oracle Contracts has the ability to dynamically
                        add clauses by evaluating the rules that users set up using Contract
                        Expert. These dynamically added clauses are generally placed in the
                        default section defined for the clause, or in the Contract Expert
                        section defined for the terms template.

                        locations in the contract in relation to other clauses. To do this,
                        while creating a Contract Expert enabled terms template, use the Insert
                        Conditional Clauses action to specify the predetermined locations
                        in the terms template for Contract Expert suggested clauses applicable
                        to the Contract Expert rules associated with the template. In this
                        case, the Insert Conditional Clauses action automatically marks these
                        Contract Expert suggested clauses as conditional.

                     <p>However, if you create a new clause for the terms
                        template and create the Contract Expert rule for it in the Terms Library,
                        and then associate this rule to the terms template, you must manually
                        mark this clause as a conditional clause before you can use the Insert
                        Conditional Clauses action to predefine its location.

                           the contract is active and in the process of being executed except
                           for internal deliverables with fixed due date that you can manually

                        <p>Here is how the two interfaces work:</p>
                        
                        <ol>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>You create the deliverable either in
                                 a contract terms template that can then be applied to the contract
                                 or directly in the contract. For the deliverable, you must enter the
                                 responsible party contact, the deliverable deadlines, and the notifications
                                 required.
                              </p>

                           <li>
                              <p> If deliverables are present in a
                                 contract terms template you apply to a contract, then the deliverables
                                 get copied to the contract automatically. The type of deliverables
                                 that are applied automatically can vary based on the document type.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>The application creates deliverable
                                 instances with the calculated deadlines based on your setups at the
                                 time the contract becomes active. For instance, if you created a deliverable
                                 that calls for the submission of a report every week after the contract
                                 is signed, then the application creates a separate instance of the
                                 deliverable for each week based on the date the contract was signed.
                              </p>

                                 use the Manage Deliverables page to access and update each deliverable
                                 instance. In the above example, each week the deliverable instance
                                 that is due that week is updated and any collateral attached.

                                 automatically notified when the deliverable is due or overdue, or
                                 when one of the parties changes its status (dashed lines).

                                 up are listed in the printed contract terms when you add the deliverable
                                 variable to a clause.

                           the parties in the contract. A repeating deliverable tracks a deliverable
                           that must be performed periodically, for instance a progress report
                           that must be submitted every week after the agreement is signed.

                           If you create a deliverable as part of a contract terms
                           template and that deliverable is of a type that is not compatible
                           with the contract where the template is applied, then the deliverable
                           does not get created in that contract. For instance, a negotiation
                           deliverable in a template is dropped when that template is applied
                           to a purchase order but added when that same template is used for
                           an RFQ.

                     <p>Use the Manage Contract Deliverables task
                        to communicate the status of deliverables to the purchasing department
                        and to submit any required documents. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>
                        
                        <p>Contract deliverables are created by the buyer as
                           part of the contract negotiations and are listed in the contract terms.
                           Each deliverable includes information about the due date and can automatically
                           notify you before it is due. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If a particular deliverable is due periodically, then
                           the application creates separate instances for each of the due dates.
                           Such repeating deliverables share the same name but have different
                           due dates. For example, a safety report that is due every month after
                           the contract is signed, results in multiple instances of the same
                           deliverable each with the appropriate due date.
                        </p>

                           deliverables to communicate with the buyer:

                                 and it is past due, the buyer changes the status to Failed to Perform.

                     <p>Contract deliverables establish and track both
                        contractual and noncontractual commitments that must be honored as
                        part of negotiations and contractual agreements between businesses
                        and suppliers or customers based on contract intent. These deliverables
                        can be used in enterprise contracts, purchasing documents, and in negotiations.

                     <p>Contract fulfillment lines in procurement
                        contracts denote commitments in terms of goods or services that must
                        be delivered. You can use contract fulfillment lines to initiate and
                        monitor purchasing activity in integrated procurement applications.
                        For example, you can use contract fulfillment to create a purchase
                        order in Oracle Fusion Purchasing for items in a contract line and
                        then monitor the purchasing activity on that purchase order as it
                        is being executed.

                     <p>You can create deliverables for a terms template
                        and apply this terms template to a contract. The deliverables from
                        the applied terms template are then visible in the Deliverables tab
                        of the contract.

                        tab using the contract header Deliverables menu item and create deliverables
                        directly in the contract.

                     <p>Internal deliverables are contract deliverables
                        used to track schedules and commitments internal to the purchasing
                        or sales organization. They are visible only to internal employees
                        and are not printed as part of the contract terms. You can manually
                        activate internal deliverables irrespective of contract status to
                        create manageable deliverable instances.

                     <p>Contractual deliverables are contract terms
                        deliverables that track commitments that must be completed as part
                        of the contract. External party contacts can view and edit only those
                        contractual deliverables for which they are the responsible party
                        contacts. Contractual deliverables are listed in the printed contract
                        terms. These deliverables are automatically activated when the contract
                        becomes active. You cannot manually activate contractual deliverables.
                        Activation creates deliverable instances that you can manage using
                        the Manage Deliverables task.
