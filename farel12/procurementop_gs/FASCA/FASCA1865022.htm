                     <h3>Contract Types: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A contract type is a contract category that
                        you must select when creating a contract. It is a mandatory setup
                        that determines the nature of the contract. For example, this step
                        determines if the contract is a project contract, a purchasing contract,
                        or simple nondisclosure or employment agreement. A contract type also
                        specifies what kind of information you can enter and what contract
                        lines, parties, and party contacts are permitted.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The contract type also specifies if electronic signature
                        is required for contract acceptance and activation and if yes, then
                        the standard email format to be used for notifying signers. In turn,
                        the requirement for electronic signature means that you must designate
                        contacts as signers on the contract. It also means that additional
                        statuses and contract header actions are available.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>This topic provides an overview of the super set of
                        contract type setups for a broad range of contracts. When setting
                        up individual contract types, only a subset of the fields listed here
                        are visible. For example, the project billing option entries are visible
                        only in contract types with a sell-intent, and the notifications fields appear
                        only for contract types with a buy-intent.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Create contract types by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Manage Contract Types</span> action from the Setup
                        and Maintenance work area. You can also create contract types in the
                        Contracts work area by selecting <span class="uicontrol">Contract
                           Types</span> under the Setup task heading. In each contract type
                        you can:

                           type and enable the contract for signature. In the e-Signature tab,
                           you can further enable the contract type for electronic signature
                           and optionally create the standard e-mail to be used when sending
                           the contract document to signers and recipients during the integrated
                           electronic signature process.

                        <p> On the contract that you create from a contract
                           type enabled for electronic signature, you must designate one or more
                           contacts on the contract as signers. Only the user with edit privileges
                           on the contract can manage the signature process. This includes sending
                           the contract for signature, editing the contract and sending it out
                           again, withdrawing the contract from the signature process, and cancelling
                           the contract sent for signature.

                           of one of the integrated applications to that line. For example, project

                           the line and use those contract deliverables to create and manage
                           purchase orders and purchase agreements in Oracle Fusion Purchasing

                     <p>You use the predefined party roles and party role

                        specify how to use them.

                     <p>You also set up the contract type. The contract type
                        determines the type of contract, and what kind of information you
                        can enter for a contract. For example, the contract lines, parties,
                        and party contacts you can enter, if you can add terms to a contract,
                        and if deliverables are included.

                        organizations could be Sales, Legal, Financial and Accounts. Defining
                        user statuses and their transitions, and contract assignment enable

                        displayed in the contract and supply the headers, footers, text style,
                        and pagination. The layout templates are RTF files stored in the BI
                        Presentation Catalog. The application comes with samples of all the

                                 the contract. If the contract does not include any contract terms,
                                 this is the only layout template used.

                                 to create the contract terms PDF. To create the contract terms PDF,
                                 you must set the terms layout template in contract type.

                                 includes both the amendment summary and the amended terms of the contract,
                                 then the application creates a PDF document of both.

                     <p>A RTF document that contains the contract
                        layout for printing and preview. The templates, which can include
                        both formatting, graphics, text, and other layout elements, are stored
                        in the Oracle BI Publisher library. You must specify layout templates
                        when you create a contract
                        type to enable printing and preview of contract, contract terms
                        and conditions, and summary of amendments made to contract terms.

                        create the contract. If you do not specify the terms layout template,
                        you cannot preview the contract terms as a PDF.

                        the key components of the Contract Terms Library and how an administrator
                        can configure them. The Contract Terms Library contains terms templates
                        that you can use to insert boilerplate terms and conditions into contracts
                        during contract authoring.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>This library contains individual sections, clauses
                        and variables. Each clause, which is usually a single paragraph, contains
                        text that specifies a set of legal terms. Clauses make up contract
                        sections, which are then assembled to create a terms template or a
                        contract's terms and conditions. Variables are used within a clause
                        to insert information into the contract terms from a sourcing document.
                        Finally, contract expert rules are made up of questions and responses
                        that drive clause selection, terms template selection, and business
                        policies and standards.
