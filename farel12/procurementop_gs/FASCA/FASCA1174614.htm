                     <p>Validate the contract before submission or the application
                        automatically validates the contract when you submit it, listing any
                        errors and warnings. You need to fix the errors but you can ignore
                        the warnings and continue with the submission. If you submit the contract
                        for approval without errors, then the application takes it to the
                        next step and enables you to review approvers before you submit the
                        contract for approval. You can add viewers and approvers to the approval
                        hierarchy and add notes to approvers that they receive along with
                        the approval notification. When you click Submit, the status of the
                        contract changes to Pending Approval.

                        approval, the contract status changes to Draft or Under Amendment

                     <p>You need to review a contract in detail to approve

                        view for the version and approval submission date and time. You can
                        also ask the contract author for more information if required, or
                        ask an approver to reexamine and reapprove the contract. Optionally,
                        delegate or transfer the approval task to another approver. If you
                        delegate the approval task to another approver, the assignee approves
                        or rejects the contract on your behalf. If you transfer the approval
                        task, you are no longer associated with the approval or rejection.

                        a new version of the contract in Draft status. Once a new version
                        of the contract is available, you can access older versions of the

                        contract does not require any signature, its status changes to Active.
                        If you reject a contract, its status changes to Draft or Under Amendment.

                     <p>If the contract requires manual signature, the signers
                        can click on the Sign Contract action and enter their signature details
                        in the Accept Contract window. If the signers are external party contacts,
                        then the internal user signs on their behalf.  The History tab of
                        an Active contract enables you to edit signature details after you
                        accept the contract.

                     <p>If the contract is enabled for electronic signature

                        on the contract to move the contract to the Sent for Signature status.
                        The sender uses the integrated electronic signature pages to manage
                        the signature process. For contracts requiring signature, the contract
                        become active only when all signers have signed the contract. To make
                        changes to an active contract, use the Amend action. This creates
                        a new version of the contract in Under Amendment status to which you
                        can make changes and then submit for approval.

                  <h2>Reviewing Contract Deviations: How It Works</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The deviation reports highlights any differences
                     between the contract terms in the contract and those in the associated
                     contract terms template and warns you of any deviations from company
                     policies. You can enter a justification for any deviations in the
                     report and make the report available for review by the contract's
                     approvers. This action is available while the contract is in a status
                     that's open to editing, such as the draft status. A copy of the report
                     is automatically attached to the contract approval notification sent
                     to contract approvers along with comments for them that you entered
                     on the report.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>You can also correct the deviation before submitting
                     it for approval. If you choose not to correct the deviation, based
                     on the deviation, then the appropriate deviation-based approval rule
                     reroutes approval for the contract provided that the deviation-based
                     approval rules have been set up in the Contract Approval Human Task.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>While the contract is closed for editing, for example,
                     when the contract was submitted for approval or was rejected, you
                     can only view the report by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">View Contract Deviations</span> action.

                     <p>Policy deviation checks are based on the values of
                        variables in the contract and the answers that you give to any questions
                        presented during authoring. For example, if you specified payment
                        terms of 30 days for a big contract, but company policy permits only
                        20 days on such contracts, this deviation is recorded in the report.
                        Policy deviations depend on Contract Expert rules set up by the Contract

                  <p>Based on your setup, a contract can become
                     active when approved. Alternatively, the contract may require to be
                     signed before it can become active. In this case, internally approving
                     a contract that is Pending Approval changes the contract status to
                     Pending Signature.

                     each party on the contract must select the Sign Contract action and
                     enter their signature details in the Accept Contract window. Each
                     of the named parties in the Accept Contract window must sign the contract
                     before the contract can change to the Active status.

                     <p>When you create a contract from a contract type enabled
                        for electronic signature, you can designate one or more party contacts
                        as signers on the Parties page and provide valid email addresses for
                        them. When the contract is in Pending Signature status, a user with
                        edit privileges on the contract can send the contract for signature
                        to the designated signers by email. Such a user can be an administrative
                        user or a user with full access on the contract.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To send the contract for signature and move the contract
                        into the Sent for Signature status, the sender must use the Sign Contract
                        action and click Send in the Sign Contract page. Clicking<span class="uicontrol">Send</span> initiates the creation of the DocuSign
                        signature envelope. This envelope that moves back and forth between
                        signers consists of the list of signers, the email subject and message,
                        the primary contract document and other attached contract documents.

                        receives an email notification from DocuSign. Once email confirmation
                        of the envelope being sent to signers is received, the contract status
                        changes to Sent for Signature.

                     <p>The signer who receives an email from DocuSign can
                        either sign or decline to sign. If the signer declines, the contract
                        status changes back from its Sent for Signature to its previous Pending
                        Signature status. The sender of the contract can then make the required
                        corrections to the envelope before resending it for signature.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the signer signs, the contract stays in the Sent
                        for Signature status while the envelope moves between signers. While
                        the contract is in Sent for Signature status, the sender can correct,
                        void, withdraw the envelope or view signature history using the Manage
                        Signatures action that launches the Manage Signatures page. If the
                        sender of the contract must make minor changes to the envelope after
                        sending it for signature such as correcting the email address of the
                        signer or adding an attachment, he can make corrections and resend
                        it for signature. To make major edits, such as changes in the legal
                        content of the contract after the contract has been signed by one
                        or more signers, the sender can cancel or void the envelope and create
                        a new one to send for signature. The envelope can also get voided
                        if it expires according to the expiry timeline set up in DocuSign.
                        Withdrawing the envelope from signature or voiding the envelope moves
                        the contract from the Sent for Signature status back to the Pending
                        Signature status.

                     <p>To check if a contract was rejected, search
                        for the contract and view the contract history. You cannot search
                        for a rejected contract by its status because a rejected contract
                        does not have status of Rejected. If a contract is rejected, its status
                        is changed back to Draft. To view rejection reasons see the comments
                        section of the snapshot view.

                        from the contract terms template and any departures in the contract
                        from company policies. A copy of the report with your comments can

                        the contract for approval. Fixing warnings on the report is optional.

                     <p>Contract deviations and validations do overlap. The
                        Contract Deviations report lists invalid clauses that will generate
                        errors when you validate the contract, for example. Examples of invalid
                        clauses include clauses that were placed on hold or have expired.
                        But the validation checks are more comprehensive and include checks
                        for errors in variable definitions, for instance. The following table
                        compares the features of contract deviation and contract terms validation:

                     <h3>How can I add more approvers and viewers to the approval hierarchy?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>If you are a contract approver and received
                        an approval notification, then you can use the link in the notification
                        to navigate to the page for Approval of Contract. On this page, you
                        can view contract details, attachments, and comments, and the approval
                        hierarchy. You can use the Add Assignee icon to add new approvers
                        and viewers in a specified location in the hierarchy. A viewer is
                        an FYI assignee or approver, who is copied on the approval notifications
                        but who has no edit privileges.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>If you create or edit a contract with or without
                        the Wizard, you can also add approvers and viewers when submitting
                        a contract for approval. The first step of the approval process is
                        to validate contracts and then review approvers and the approval hierarchy.
                        While reviewing approvers, you can add approvers and viewers as required.
                        In addition, you can add notes to approvers that are displayed in
                        their approval notification.
                     </p>

                        You cannot add approvers or viewers when submitting
                        a contract for approval using the Submit for Approval action from
                        the Pending Approvals bin or from the Contracts Search region of the
                        contracts work area. 
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <p>Approvers or approver groups are also automatically
                        added to the approval hierarchy for the approval of specific clause
                        or policy contract deviations if your contract administrator has configured
                        these deviation-based approval rules for the Contract Approval Human
                        Task. Thus, based on the deviation in the Review Contract Deviations
                        page the appropriate approval rule reroutes approval.
