                  <p>All users with appropriate roles can create
                     and access analyses and reports based on role access to subject areas
                     and catalog folders.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Analyses and reports are secured by applying job
                     roles with associated duty roles to users. Duty role assignments determine
                     access to subject areas for analyses as well as catalog folders. For
                     information about the job and duty roles provided with Procurement
                     Cloud, see the Oracle Procurement Cloud Security Reference guide.
                     For information about how to customize your security model by creating
                     custom job roles and assigning duty roles to them, see the Oracle
                     ERP Cloud Securing Oracle ERP guide.

                  <p>In addition to folder and object access, duty roles
                     also determine data security. Each of the duty roles that provides
                     access to subject areas and catalog folders is granted one or more
                     data security policies that allow access to the data.
