                              to create a base negotiation document containing much of the line
                              and supplier-related information. Once you have a template defined,
                              you can reuse it without having to reenter negotiation information.
                              You must have access to the Procurement Business Unit for this the
                              template was defined to access it.

                           <p>You can use requisitions in Purchasing
                              to create a negotiation document. When you use this method, the requisition
                              information is used to create the negotiation lines.

                     <p>If you create your negotiation from scratch, as you
                        create your negotiation, a series of train stops appear at the top
                        of every page. These identify major sections of the negotiation document
                        for which you may need to enter information, depending on the goal
                        of the negotiation. The following descriptions describe the purpose
                        for each negotiation section. Note that depending on which negotiation
                        style you are using, one or more of the sections may not be available
                        for use and so may not appear among the train stops.

                           Such information could identify important deliverables or contract
                           clauses suppliers must provide along with the timeline governing the
                           deliverable management. See help information on Procurement Contracts

                        <p>The Suppliers train stop gives you access to the Supplier-related
                           pages. Using these pages, you can specify the suppliers, their sites
                           and contacts whom you wish to notify about the negotiation. You can
                           use the search capabilities of the Supplier pages to find and identify
                           incumbent suppliers, suppliers who are approved sources for a particular
                           item or service, and suppliers to whom the negotiation is of particular
                           interest. Supplier contacts you identify are sent notifications with
                           information about the negotiation and are invited to participate.
                           If the response control: "Restrict to invited suppliers" is enabled,
                           only suppliers on the invitation list can participate. If you select
                           a supplier site, then for that supplier, only contacts registered
                           for that site can view and participate in the negotiation.

                        <p>The application validates your work as you create
                           the negotiation document. As you move from one page to another, the
                           application checks your work and displays any error messages applicable
                           to the work you have completed so far. Additionally, you can use the
                           Validate option from the Actions menu at any time. You can also use
                           the Review train stop to review your work at a higher and more complete
                           level. The review display presents a column of links you can use to
                           access a particular section of the document. If you wish to update
                           a section, you can click the train stop at the top of the page.

                        <p>Once you are finished creating the negotiation document,
                           you publish it to make it visible and accessible within the application.
                           Suppliers can view the negotiation during the preview period (if any)
                           and can create draft responses, but they cannot submit the response
                           to the negotiation until its open date is reached. You can always
                           modify the negotiation internally, for example, by inviting additional
                           suppliers or updating the collaboration team, however, once you publish
                           a document, you must create an amendment to make any changes the suppliers
                           see.

                           be submitted to approvers for review. Then once all approvals have
                           been obtained, the negotiation document is automatically published.

                     <p>When creating a negotiation document, you can
                        use placeholders called variables to represent textual entries in
                        the document. The variables refer to pieces of information defined
                        elsewhere in the document. After the value of the referenced information
                        is entered, users can see the variable substituted with that value
                        in the Preview window as well as on the Review page. Using variables
                        allows you to ensure that the document is current and that any necessary
                        updates are made consistently throughout the entire document.

                        <p>For example, on a negotiation document cover page,
                           the title and open and close dates could be specified as variables.
                           Then at a later point during document creation, when the title and
                           open/close dates are actually specified, the variable values on the
                           cover page would be assigned. Also, if at a later date, the title,
                           open or close dates are modified, the variable values are automatically
                           updated.

                        you select when you begin creating the negotiation, but you can override

                        <p>Unless otherwise restricted, a supplier can search
                           and see any negotiation in preview or active status that is associated
                           with a business unit to which the supplier has access. The supplier
                           can participate in any visible negotiation unless you specify that
                           the participants are limited to those suppliers explicitly invited.
                           For example, you might wish to limit participation in a negotiation
                           to only incumbent suppliers. In this case, you select the "Restrict
                           to invited suppliers" response rule. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The default for RFQs is to restrict to invited suppliers. </p>

                           in the negotiation, or allow the supplier contact to select which
                           lines she replies to. For example, if you have a large negotiation
                           with many lines covering many different product types, you may wish
                           to allow suppliers to only respond to the items or services they provide.

                        <p>In open negotiations, suppliers can see information
                           from competing responses. In blind negotiations however, suppliers
                           cannot see any other suppliers' responses. In a negotiation that allows
                           multiple responses within the same round, you may wish to display
                           the best price value so the supplier knows how much to reduce the
                           response price to become competitive again. You can do this by enabling
                           the "Display best price to suppliers" response control.

                           contact per round. However, you can allow supplier contacts to submit
                           multiple responses within the same round. For example, you might wish
                           to allow multiple responses to foster competition among several suppliers.

                        in the negotiation document. The second (and remaining) negotiation
                        line remains open. After the specified staggered closing period, the

                        each line closing after its preceding line. Lines in lots or groups
                        have the same close time. When using staggered closing, the lines
                        close in the order they are defined in the document, the sequence
                        in which the lines appear on the negotiation document is important.

                        capabilities can be performed using the style. For example, you can
                        define a simple negotiation style and then use it to create very straightforward,
                        streamlined negotiations. Alternately, you can create a negotiation
                        style that takes advantage of many processing features. You can then
                        use this style to create a complex negotiation.

                     <p>Using negotiation styles, you can define default
                        textual content for use in a negotiation document. Also, you can select
                        which negotiation capabilities are available when using this negotiation
                        style.

                           such as the negotiation close date. The negotiation controls that

                        <p>Allow autoextend - allows autoextensions to be defined
                           for this negotiation. Checking Allow autoextend displays the following
                           autoextend controls.

                           have an autoextension triggered for any number of the top ranked bids.
                           For example, you could choose to have autoextension triggered whenever
                           you receive a better bid for not only the current winning bid, but
                           also for the current second or third best bids as well. If you know
                           you award this line to multiple suppliers, the feature enables you
                           to encourage competition on not just the top bid, but competing bids
                           as well. Enable this feature by specifying the bid rank for which
                           the receipt of a bid ranked in this position or higher triggers autoextend.
                           If this field is left blank, any bid triggers autoextensions.

                        <p>Lines to Autoextend - Identifies individual lines
                           to autoextend. You can choose to autoextend all lines or only the
                           lines that triggered the autoextend.

                        <p>Start Time of Autoextensions - You can start autoextensions
                           from the scheduled close time of the auction or the time that a triggering
                           bid is received during the triggering period prior to the close time.
                           For example, if you select "Close date" and you enable an autoextend
                           start time of 30 minutes, if triggering bid is received within the
                           final 30 minutes of the auction, your auction automatically extends
                           for 30 minutes past the scheduled close time. However, if you select
                           "Receipt time of triggering response," your extension begins as soon
                           as a triggering bid is received within the triggering period.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Triggering Period - the period prior to the close
                           date during which responses can trigger autoextend.

                        <p>Length of Extensions - the duration of each autoextension</p>
                        
                        <p>Number of Extensions - the number of times a negotiation
                           autoextend. Leaving this field blank allows an unlimited number of
                           autoextensions. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you could specify a triggering period
                           of 30 minutes, an extension length of 20 minutes, and a start time
                           of close date. With these settings, if a triggering bid is received
                           at any time within the last 30 minutes of the auction, the close date
                           is moved to 20 minutes past the original close date and time.

                        which processing capabilities can be performed using the style. You

                           the document.

                           supplier-side document, and you could use Solicitation for the buyer-side

                     <p>A strategic sourcing initiative can contain
                        multiple stages from spend analysis to contract award to contract
                        creation.  Many organizations manage these stages as a project with
                        numerous project members, tasks and deliverables. Project management
                        is often necessary to coordinate and execute on sourcing initiatives
                        including managing tasks, allocating resources, and reporting on actual
                        savings.  Managing sourcing initiatives often requires coordination
                        among various stakeholders, including category managers, project managers,
                        and suppliers.

                     <p>You can associate a negotiation created in Sourcing
                        with the project plan created in project management. You can also associate
                        a project task progress to a specific event in the negotiation life
                        cycle, so when the negotiation event occurs the project task progress
                        is updated automatically. This association or linking happens at the
                        individual project task level. Associating a negotiation at the project
                        task level gives you the flexibility to link a single project plan
                        to multiple negotiations or a single negotiation to multiple project
                        plans, but it also associates the progress of a project task to a
                        specific sourcing event that can occur in the negotiation life cycle. 
                     </p>

                        <p>You can create the association between a negotiation
                           and a project plan in two ways. You can create and associate the negotiation
                           while you are defining the project plan. Otherwise, you can create
                           and associate the project plan while you are defining your negotiation.
                           You must be a project manager to create a project plan.

                        <p>Project plan tasks can be tied to negotiation events
                           that occur throughout life cycle of a negotiation, and you can view
                           a task's status while in Sourcing (you can only see the tasks that
                           are associated with a negotiation event). When you associate a project
                           task to a negotiation, you can optionally select a Task Completion
                           Event for that association. This enables you to associate a project
                           task's progress to negotiation events that occur in the life cycle
                           of a negotiation. When the event occurs the project task progress
                           is updated automatically. These task completion negotiation events
                           are predefined and they are of 2 types - Manual and Automatic. When
                           a task is tied to an automatic event, the task progress is automatically
                           updated when the negotiation event occurs. When a task is tied to
                           a manual event, then you need to manually perform the complete task
                           action in Sourcing to mark the event as complete.

                                 to task completion events only if they are not completed, that is,
                                 percent complete is not 100%. But you can always remove existing project
                                 tasks that are not tied to any task completion events.

                                 old negotiation automatically point to the new amendment. If a project

                                 the old negotiation.

                           and report on price competition. The Start Price value controls responding
                           and requires that the supplier enter the initial response at a price
                           lower that the Start Price value. The Current Price value specifies
                           how much you are currently spending for one unit of the item or service.
                           If you enter a current price value, Oracle Sourcing can calculate
                           and display the savings. The savings values are useful later when
                           analyzing competing responses. 
                        </p>

                        <p>In addition to price, there is other information you
                           can add to your lines and negotiate with your potential supplier. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Cost factors identify additional costs which may be
                           associated with the item or service. Such additional costs could include
                           custom duties, storage, or transportation. You can identify these
                           costs with your negotiation line and include supplier responses into
                           the total cost of the line when analyzing responses. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can use price breaks and price tiers to negotiate
                           pricing structures. You can create price breaks for negotiations with
                           a purchase agreement outcome based on location, quantity, and start/end
                           dates. You can define price tiers for all negotiation outcomes based
                           on quantity alone. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can use line attributes to obtain detailed information
                           about the supplier's response to the negotiation line. Line attributes
                           target information other than price which could be important when
                           evaluating supplier responses. You can allow suppliers to enter free
                           form text, or require them to select from a predefined list of acceptable
                           values. If the negotiation is a multiattribute negotiation, you can
                           enter response score values, and the Sourcing calculates the score
                           for a particular response. A line can have multiple attributes and
                           each attribute can be weighted to reflect the relative importance
                           of that attribute for the line. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>There are two methods for adding attributes to a
                           line. You can create and add multiple single attributes to a line,
                           or you can add one or more predefined lists of attributes called an
                           attribute list. If predefined grouping labels (called Attribute Groups)
                           are defined in your application, you can use these labels to structure
                           your attributes and attribute lists. 
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Lots and Groups</h4>
                        
                        <p>Category managers can define lots that contain a collection
                           of lines, giving a hierarchical structure to the sourcing document.
                           A lot may be an assembled product or lines may be organized into lots
                           to obtain the most competitive response. Suppliers are required to
                           evaluate the entire lot and place a response at the lot level. Suppliers
                           may optionally provide line-level responses as well. Category managers
                           analyze the responses and make award decisions at the lot level. When
                           the category manager creates a purchasing document from the award,
                           awarded lots are transferred to purchasing document lines. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Negotiation lines can also be organized into groups
                           for ease of analysis and award. Groups are collections of related
                           lines that allow category managers to model market baskets. Suppliers
                           respond to individual lines within the group, and pricing information
                           is automatically rolled up to the group level for enhanced analysis.
                           Category managers can analyze and make award decisions for the entire
                           group, or they can choose to select the best supplier responses for
                           individual lines within the group. Awarded lines are transferred to
                           the purchasing document, if the category manager created one from
                           the award.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>A lot is a complete negotiation line on its own. As
                           such, it can have line attributes, cost factors, and any other characteristics
                           a negotiation line. A group is simply a named collection of negotiation
                           lines. Groups have no attributes other than price (which is the sum
                           of all its line price values). Lots and groups must have at least
                           one subordinate line defined. You cannot imbed lots within groups
                           or groups within lots. You can add independent lines into lots and
                           groups (although you cannot move a line with a backing requisition
                           into a lot), and you can move lot lines and group lines into other
                           lots and/or groups.

                        <p>You can use the spreadsheet import feature to streamline
                           the creation of large numbers of lines. You simply export and save
                           the spreadsheet template. Using the reference information, you complete
                           the spreadsheet with your line information. Once the spreadsheet is
                           completed, you import it back into the application. During the import
                           process, each line is verified. If any error is found, all line information
                           is reversed, and error messages alert you to the problems the application
                           found. You can correct the spreadsheet and reimport to correct the

                           with an alternate line. This alternate response line is in addition
                           to the supplier's response to the line you originally defined to the
                           negotiation. The supplier might want to add a new line to suggest
                           alternate response information such as a different set of price breaks,
                           cost factors, line attributes, or UOM specifications. To allow alternate

                     <p>Importing negotiation lines by spreadsheet
                        enables you to effectively reduce negotiation creation time by completing
                        a spreadsheet file offline and then using that file to import your
                        line information. This feature is especially useful for negotiations
                        with a large number of lines or complex lines with multiple attributes.
                        This topic contains instructions on how to complete the spreadsheet
                        file and import it to your new negotiation.

                     <p>The .zip file you export contains a template for you
                        to fill out. You have other reference files containing any cost factors,
                        UOM values, and attribute groups that exist in the application in
                        case you need to use them. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Once you have exported the appropriate spreadsheet
                        files, fill in the template file with your negotiation line information.
                        The table below describes each spreadsheet field in detail and indicates
                        which fields are required and which are optional. Required fields
                        are marked with an asterisk (*). You must enter a value for a required.
                        You do not have to enter a value for an optional field.    
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The table also explains each field's length restrictions.
                        If a field's maximum data length is 4000 characters, the length for
                        a multi-byte language such as Japanese the limit is smaller.  If the
                        field length is less than 4000 characters, the maximum length is the
                        same for both single-byte and multi-byte languages. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following table shows the fields as they appear
                        in the exported spreadsheet. Some columns always appear while other
                        columns appear depending on which negotiation outcome is selected,
                        standard purchase order or blanket or contract purchase agreement.
                        Generally, you can rearrange the column sequence but should not change
                        the column titles. The attribute and cost factor columns are an exception
                        to this rule. They should not be rearranged. The cost factor columns
                        must immediately precede the attribute columns and the attribute columns
                        need to immediately precede the End of Line Delimiter column. Be sure
                        that the End of Line Delimiter column is the last column of your spreadsheet.
                        You may also delete optional columns; see the Note below the table
                        for more details.

                     <p>Notes: All date, time and price format settings should
                        be the same as your user preference settings in the application; for
                        example, 1212,40 vs. 1,212.40. When entering numeric values into the
                        specified fields, set the cell format as Text; other formats might
                        result in error upon importing. If the format is Text and the length
                        is longer than 255 characters, set the cell format as General. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Note that the application treats the values you enter
                        as case sensitive. For example, Lot line is correct, Lot Line is not
                        and causes an error.

                        <p>The spreadsheet template contains the
                           six columns (Line Target Price , Display Line Target Price, Cost Factor,
                           Pricing Basis, Cost Factor Target Value, Display Cost Factor Target)
                           that are required to define one cost factor. If you wish to enter
                           more cost factors, for each additional cost factor, copy the last
                           four columns (Cost Factor, Pricing Basis, Cost Factor Target Value,
                           Display Cost Factor Target) and insert them after the existing six
                           columns. You can enter as many cost factors as you want. Cost factor
                           columns can be blank. For example, you may want to have the first
                           cost factor for every line to be Tooling. However, if Tooling does
                           not apply to a particular line, simply leave the columns referring
                           to Tooling blank for that line.

                        <p>The spreadsheet
                           template contains the six columns (Attribute, Attribute Group, Attribute

                           Target) that are required to define one attribute. If you want to
                           enter more attributes, simply copy the attribute columns and insert
                           them at the end of the spreadsheet immediately preceding the End of
                           Line Delimiter column. You can enter as many attributes as you want.
                           Attribute columns can be blank. For example, you may want to have
                           the first attribute for every line to be Grade. If Grade does not
                           apply to a particular line, simply leave the columns referring to
                           Grade blank for that line.

                           you cannot delete the following columns: Action (when creating amendments
                           or new rounds of responding), Type, Internal Line ID (when creating
                           amendments or new rounds of responding), End of Line Delimiter. Also,
                           the six attribute columns and the six cost factor columns must be
                           treated as a group: either all columns are deleted or none is deleted.

                              <p>Errors are listed in a table, which identifies the
                                 Spreadsheet Row Number, Column Title, Value, and Error that occurred.
                                 Common errors include: 
                              </p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>File errors occur when your spreadsheet
                                       file type or file format does not match the import format type supported
                                       by the application. For example, if you import a word-processing file
                                       which the application does not recognize, a file error occurs.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Format errors occur when information
                                       that you entered in your spreadsheet cannot be understood by the application.
                                       For example, if you enter alphabetic characters into fields where
                                       only numeric characters are expected, a format error appears. Also
                                       check that the column names and column sequence in the file you are
                                       importing matches the names and sequence in the file you exported.
                                       
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Validation errors occur when information
                                       that you entered on your spreadsheet does not match corresponding
                                       information already held within the application. For example, if you
                                       enter values for UOM or, Category Name that the application does not
                                       recognize, a validation error occurs. 
                                    </p>
                                 </li>

                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>If any of your spreadsheet lines
                                 contain errors, the application indicates the necessary corrections.
                                 Open the spreadsheet file you tried to import, make changes where
                                 necessary, save the file, browse to locate the updated file, and run
                                 the import process again. Note: If any error occurs during the import,
                                 none of the lines are loaded. Note also that since the errors are
                                 checked in phases, you may need to try importing more than once to
                                 fix all the errors and obtain a clean import. 
                              </p>

                              <p>If the application detects no error
                                 on your spreadsheet, all of your negotiation lines import successfully.
                                 You can then edit any of your lines.

                        <p>You can use the line import spreadsheet to amend the list of lines
                           in a subsequent round of responding. When you start a new round of
                           responding you can add, delete, and update lines from a spreadsheet.
                           This gives you the flexibility to quickly launch the new round. To
                           adjust the list of lines using a spreadsheet you typically follow
                           these steps:

                     <p>Quantity-based price tiers and price breaks
                        allow you to negotiate line prices with your supplier based on characteristics
                        of your order. For example, with both price tiers and price breaks,
                        you may expect to receive a discount from your supplier if you buy
                        a large quantity of units, and you may specify several quantity levels
                        and the prices you are willing to pay at each. Or by negotiating using
                        price breaks, you may additionally choose to pay more per unit if
                        your supplier can ship the order to a special location or by a certain
                        deadline.

                        a negotiation document: quantity-based price tiers and price breaks.
                        If tiers or breaks are defined, suppliers must reply by entering prices,
                        or modifying the tiers or breaks (if the negotiation creator allows
                        price break modifications). If there are no tiers or breaks defined,
                        the supplier can add tiers or breaks. You can only use quantity-based
                        price tiers or price breaks if the negotiation style you are using
                        allows them..

                           price tiers, or add their own. For quantity-based price tiers, only

                           attributes for the line. Note that while each value's score can be
                           between 0 and 100, the weights for all the attributes defined for
                           a line must add up to 100.

                     <p>Line attributes make your negotiation line
                        more descriptive and can also be used to ensure that all responses
                        submitted for the line include specific additional details. The response
                        values suppliers provide can also be used together with price offered
                        when ranking responses in multi-attribute ranked negotiations. When
                        you create your negotiation lines, you can add line attributes and
                        require suppliers to respond by selecting a value from a group of
                        values you can specify. Then when you evaluate the supplier responses,
                        you can weighted and score the attribute responses and use this additional
                        information used to make your award decision.

                        <p>For example, a category manager can create an auction
                           to buy vehicles for a delivery service. When she adds the line (for
                           example, called vehicle) to the auction, she can then set up ranges
                           of mileage from which the supplier could select a value. Furthermore,
                           if the category manager marks this attribute as required, then suppliers
                           must specify the mileage of any response.

                        <p>Line attributes can call attention to common or industry-specific
                           characteristics. For example, retail industry negotiation items can
                           include such attributes as "color," "style," and "SKUnumber." Metal
                           industry negotiation items can include "grade of metal" as an attribute.
                           Adding these as required item attributes that are displayed to suppliers
                           can customize your negotiation items to your specific industry.

                     <p>Attribute lists are collections of line attributes
                        that are commonly used together. Procurement application administrators
                        can create public attribute lists for use when creating negotiations.
                        When a negotiation author associates an attribute list with a negotiation
                        line, all the attributes on the list are associated with the line.
                        Any attributes on the list that are not needed can be deleted, and
                        additional line attributes can be created if necessary. Attribute
                        lists are an efficient way to streamline the negotiation creation
                        process. They can also be used to encourage standardization and best
                        practices.

                        to past performance, the category manager wants to keep BWP Distributors,

                     <p>You can select one or more suppliers (and
                        their contacts) and invite them to participate in the negotiation.
                        For those suppliers you identify, notifications are sent containing
                        information on the negotiation. If you select a supplier site, then
                        for that supplier, only contacts registered with that site receive
                        invitations. If you enable the response control: "Restrict to invited
                        suppliers," only suppliers in the invitation list can participate.
                        Otherwise, any supplier who is registered with the application can
                        view the negotiation and participate. You can only invite a supplier
                        once, but you can invite multiple sites for that supplier. There are
                        several methods you can use when inviting suppliers.

                        you can enter it directly into the negotiation. This is the quickest

                        and invite suppliers based on multiple search criteria such as the
                        supplier's business classification, Approved Supplier List status,
                        transaction history, or qualification and assessment status.

                     <p>You can register a new supplier while creating the
                        negotiation. Selecting the Register and Add option from the Actions
                        menu on the Edit Negotiation: Suppliers page takes you to the Register
                        and Add Supplier page where you can enter information about the new
                        company, its sites, and create a company contact.

                        prospective supplier or a spend authorized. If you register the company
                        as a prospective supplier, the supplier can participate as soon as
                        its registration is approved. A prospective supplier can receive invitations,
                        view a negotiation and respond. You can award the supplier business,
                        but you cannot issue a purchase document for the supplier until it
                        is approved for conducting financial transactions with your buying

                     <p>When you begin a business relationship with
                        a supplier, the supplier usually has a provisional status. For a provisional
                        supplier, the amount of information you need is typically minimal.
                        You need more information for suppliers with whom you conduct financial
                        transaction. The level of review and oversight needed for a potential
                        supplier is also typically less than that required by a contracted
                        supplier.

                     <p>An efficient way of addressing the need for different
                        levels of supplier information is to provide two statuses for the
                        suppliers. The provisional status allows a restricted level of access
                        to the application capabilities. The full status allows access to
                        a more complete range of capabilities.

                           web page, or they can be registered internally, for example, a category
                           manager can request to register a new supplier when completing an
                           invitation list for a new negotiation. In either case, the registration
                           requests go to the supplier manager for review. Once the supplier
                           manager approves the registration request, the supplier becomes a
                           prospective supplier in the application. Prospective suppliers have
                           a restricted level of access. They can participate in supplier qualification
                           initiatives, and they can view and respond to negotiations. Prospective

                           needs to be authorized in the application to conduct spend transactions
                           with the buying organization before a purchase document can be created
                           for that supplier. Spend authorization requires a more complete level
                           of information about the supplier and is subject to approval by the
                           supplier manager. Once the supplier is approved for spend operations,
                           they have access to all the normal capabilities of the application.

                        <p>Prospective suppliers are provisional suppliers that
                           are newly registered with the application. These suppliers have not
                           been authorized to conduct spend operations with the buying organization.
                           You can award business to prospective suppliers, but before the  award
                           can be completed, any prospective suppliers must be spend authorized
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>When you complete your award decision, if any business
                           has been awarded to prospective suppliers, the negotiation moves to
                           Award Completion in Progress. The application sends a request to the
                           supplier manager to authorize the supplier for spend operations. Once
                           the supplier is spend authorized, an entry appears in the Recent Activity
                           table in your workbench notifying you that the supplier is now spend
                           authorized. Also, a notification is sent to the original requester
                           of the spend authorization (note that if the supplier was already
                           in the process of being authorized when you made your award decision,
                           the application does not consider you the original authorization
                           requester, and you won't receive this notification)
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You must monitor your Recent Activity table to know
                           when the spend authorization requests have been processed. Once all
                           the prospective suppliers who have been awarded business for a negotiation
                           are spend authorized, you can create the purchase documents for that
                           negotiation.

                        <p>If the authorization request is rejected, an entry
                           shows up in your Recent Activity table and you receive a notification
                           (if you are the originating requester). The status for the negotiation
                           reverts back to its previous status, either Award in Progress or Award
                           Approved.

                        any error messages as you move from one page to another. At any point,

                        such as the suppliers themselves, or internal, such as collaboration
                        team members.  You solicit this information by adding one or more
                        questions for the supplier to answer. These questions are called requirements.

                     <p>Using requirements allows you to obtain important

                        can copy and use them as requirement sections. If any questions defined
                        in the Supplier Qualification question library reference an attribute
                        in the supplier profile, any supplier response to that question will

                        it contains technical or commercial requirements. You can have multiple
                        technical sections and multiple commercial sections, but you need
                        at least one of each. In a two stage RFQ, the technical requirement
                        are evaluated before the commercial requirements.

                        Supplier answers to requirements are used in combination with prices

                                 For these requirements, you define the acceptable values in terms

                                 any scoring method. You define the acceptable values as a list of

                        <p>Requirements are used to solicit information from
                           suppliers. How this information is used is up to the buyer who defines
                           the requirement. Requirements can have a score method of None, in
                           which case the response from the supplier is for information only
                           and is not used to determine awards. Requirements can be scored automatically,
                           in which case scoring criteria defined by the buyer is used by the
                           application to obtain a score for the supplier response. Finally,
                           scores can be manually viewed by an evaluator who determines a score
                           value and entered it into the document. Score values entered either
                           automatically or manually can be used to help determine award decisions.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">How Score Values are Calculated</h4>
                        
                        <p>When the buyer defines the requirements, a maximum
                           score value is set for all requirements which will be scored. Requirements
                           with a scoring method of None are not scored and therefore have no
                           maximum score value. At award time, the score value (either entered
                           manually or generated automatically) is divided by the value for Maximum
                           Score and the result multiplied by the weight of the Requirement.
                           The weighted scores are rolled up to the response level, that is,
                           a weighted score is calculated for each requirement, each requirement

                     <p>The Question Library is a collection of existing
                        questions. You can use the entries in the question library when you
                        are defining qualification areas in Oracle Supplier Qualification
                        Management. You can also use the existing questions as the basis for
                        requirements in Oracle Sourcing negotiations.

                        <p>You can create questions in the question library
                           which can be reused in sourcing negotiations. The questions are version
                           controlled and support similar attributes as requirements. When category
                           managers build the requirements during negotiation creation, they
                           have the ability to search and add questions directly to negotiations.
                           When they add the predefined questions, all the relevant attributes
                           of the questions will be copied over to requirements as read only.
                           You can use questions from the Question Library without implementing
                           Oracle Supplier Qualification Management. You can run a task, Manage
                           Supplier Questions, in Setup and Maintenance to implement the Question

                           Management is implemented, you can add qualification areas during
                           negotiation creation. Qualification areas are collections of related
                           questions that are used to qualify a specific aspect of suppliers.
                           When you add predefined qualification areas, the qualification area
                           names are copied as requirement section names, and all the questions
                           within the qualification areas are copied as requirements within the
                           requirement sections. If necessary, you can change the scoring information.

                        <p>To
                           add new acceptable values for a requirement, highlight any of the
                           rows for the requirement. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Add Acceptable
                              Value</span> option. A new row is added to the acceptable values
                           area for the requirement. Note that depending on which requirement
                           type and scoring method you select, the spreadsheet will automatically
                           generate a set of five rows where you can enter acceptable values.

                        <p>Once you complete your spreadsheet, save it locally.
                           When you are ready to upload your new requirement information, click
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Generate Upload File</span> option.
                           This creates a .zip file in the same folder where you saved your spreadsheet
                           after you completed it. To upload the requirements to your negotiation,
                           navigate to the Edit Negotiations: Requirements page. From the Actions
                           menu, select the <span class="uicontrol">Add by Spreadsheet</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Import Requirements</span> option.
                           Browse to the location where you saved your spreadsheet and where
                           the generated .zip file is stored. Select the .zip file and click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.

                        <p>Note that on the

                           existing requirements with your new requirements.

                     <h3>Using a Two-Stage RFQ: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Government organizations and departments
                        as well as other public sector enterprises such as banks often follow
                        a two-stage RFQ process. This process involves the submission of quotes
                        in two separate sealed envelopes. One contains what is called the
                        technical quote, and the other contains what is called the commercial
                        quote. The technical quote includes all responses by a supplier to
                        questions and parameters pertaining to the technical aspects that
                        are used by the sourcing organization to evaluate the technical feasibility
                        of the quotes and the capacity of the suppliers. The commercial quote
                        addresses the issues of price and other factors associated with the
                        execution of the sourced items.

                     <p>This two stage process is prevalent among some public
                        sector and many government organizations where it's sometimes mandated
                        by law that the buying organization offer the tender or sourcing contract
                        to the lowest price bid from the qualified bidders. The buying organization
                        initially assesses the suppliers to be technically qualified before
                        their price quotes are unsealed and evaluated. This ensures no bias
                        in awarding the contract.

                     <p> The two-stage RFQ process involves the submission
                        by the suppliers of a technical quote and a commercial quote. The
                        technical quotes are opened and evaluated first to determine a list
                        of qualified suppliers, and only then are the commercial quotes of
                        the qualified suppliers opened and evaluated.

                        create the RFQ document. This document contains two or more special
                        requirement sections. For each section, you indicate if it's a technical
                        requirement section or a commercial requirement section. Technical
                        requirement sections contain all the technical specifications necessary
                        for the suppliers to successfully complete the RFQ. Commercial requirements
                        section contain all financial information the buying organization
                        needs from the supplier.

                     <p>Cost factors allow a buyer to identify and
                        control for additional costs associated with a negotiation line. Cost
                        factors can be added to lines in a negotiation document, to line defaults
                        in a negotiation template, or to cost factor lists.

                        <p>Cost factors can be defined as either a per-unit cost,
                           a percentage of the line price, or a fixed amount for the line. A
                           single line can have one or more cost factors (of any type) defined
                           for it. All cost factors are added to the line price (the price being
                           offered by the supplier per unit) to obtain the response price. The
                           response price is the actual price per unit when all applicable cost
                           factors are applied. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Response price is calculated as follows:   line price
                           + ((line price * any percentage of line cost factor) + any per-unit
                           cost factor + (any fixed amount cost factor / response quantity))

                           a supplier's response is adjusted to take into account all the cost
                           factors defined by the buyer. The numbers represent the values entered
                           by the supplier for the line price and all the cost factors.

                     <p>You can use cost factors to obtain a more realistic
                        idea of the total cost of an item or service by factoring in any additional
                        costs beyond just price. Such costs could include additional costs
                        such as consulting or training. Cost factors can be added to a negotiation
                        line, to lines in negotiation templates, or to collections of cost
                        factors (called cost factor lists). A negotiation line can have more
                        than one cost factor (of any type) defined to it. You can create three
                        types of cost factors.

                     <p>A cost factor list is a set of cost factors
                        which are commonly used together. Once cost factors are placed on
                        a list, you can apply the list to a negotiation line, and all the
                        cost factors on the list are carried over to the line. Once applied
                        to the line, you can delete unneeded cost factors or add additional
                        cost factors as appropriate. Applying cost factor lists enables you
                        to quickly associate a large number of cost factors with a negotiation
                        line. Once the procurement application administrator has added the
                        cost factors to the application, you can create a new cost factor
                        list.

                        offered by the supplier. The main difference is that price tiers are
                        available with all negotiation outcomes, but price breaks are only
                        available with documents having a purchase agreement negotiation outcome.
                        Also, price breaks can be cumulative across the life of the agreement.

                     <p>Additionally, price breaks can base price reductions
                        on Ship-to Organization, Location, Quantity, and Start and End dates.
                        Price tier reductions are based only on Quantity.

                     <p>You can use both negotiation styles and negotiation
                        templates when creating negotiation documents. The purpose for each
                        is different, however, they both help shorten the creation process.
                        A negotiation style uses only the creation features necessary to create
                        the target type of negotiation. Any features not required are not
                        accessible using that negotiation style. For example, if line attributes
                        are not appropriate to a particular type of negotiation, the procurement
                        application administrator can create a negotiation style that omits
                        line attributes. When that negotiation style is used to create a negotiation
                        document, the application pages used to create line attributes do
                        not appear. By focusing only on the features required by the type
                        of negotiation, the creation process is shortened.

                     <p>A negotiation template is a skeleton you apply
                        to a new negotiation you are creating. Negotiation templates can provide
                        default data for many of the negotiation document attributes, for
                        example addresses or invited suppliers. You can modify some of these
                        attributes when creating your new negotiation document.

                     <p>Negotiation templates also let companies standardize
                        practices on negotiation creation. For example, different templates
                        can be used with different item categories. You must have access to
                        the Procurement Business Unit under which the template was created
                        to access and use it.

                     <p>You have several possible ways to modify the

                        early or extend the negotiation past its original close date and time.
                        Automatic extensions are also a method you can use to control when
                        a negotiation closes. You define the automatic extension criteria,
                        consisting of the triggering period (a time period prior to the close
                        date/time), the extension length, and the extension scope. Then if
                        a qualifying response is received during the triggering period, the
                        closing time for any negotiation line that falls within the scope
                        of the autoextension is extended by the extension length to become
                        the new close time.

                        can apply to a negotiation line. When you apply a cost factor list,
                        all the cost factors on the list are associated with that line. You
                        can delete any cost factors you don't need. Cost factor lists allow
                        you to quickly associate a group of related or commonly used cost
                        factors with a negotiation line. This speeds up the creation process.

                        <h4>Document and Award Approvals: Explained</h4>
                        <p>Your application may use the approval management
                           system to track and manage approvals of both your negotiation document
                           and your award decisions. You can approve the negotiation document,
                           the negotiation award, or both. When approvals are used, internal
                           reviewers view and OK the details of the negotiation document and
                           the final award decision. 
                        </p>
                        <div class="sect4" id="OAPRC1220722"><h5 class="topictitle">How Approvals Work</h5>
                           <p>If approvals are enabled, you can have both the negotiation
                              document and the award decision subject to approval before they can
                              be further processed. The Approvals Management Extension is an automated
                              process in which approval checks are passed from a user, a group of
                              users, or the application to another user or group of users for consideration
                              or action. Similarly, after you make an award decision, you can submit
                              it for approval. 
                           </p>
                           <p>When the negotiation document requires approval,
                              you submit the document for approval once you have completed it. When
                              the document has been approved, the application automatically publishes
                              it. The new status for the document depends on the open and preview
                              dates. 
                           </p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>
                                 <p>If the open date is Upon Approval,
                                    the status is Active.
                                 </p>

                                    dates are in the future, the status is Submitted.

                              </li>
                           </ul>
                           <p>For award approval, once the award has been approved,
                              the status changes to Approved, and you can complete the award and
                              generate the purchase documents.
                           </p>
                           <p>Whether a document or award needs approval depends
                              on the approval rules that are defined for the task. For example,
                              a negotiation could be subject to approval because it includes items
                              from a particular category, or an award decision could need approval
                              because the award amount is over a certain limit.
                           </p>
                           <p>While a negotiation document is being approved, the
                              status of the negotiation is Approval in Progress. While the award
                              is being approved, the status is Award Approval in Process. If there
                              is an issue and an approver rejects the document or award, you receive
                              a notification with information about the rejection. You can edit
                              and update the document or award and resubmit it for approval. Once
                              the document or award is approved, the status changes to Approved,
                              and you receive a notification that the approval is successful. Then
                              you can continue processing the negotiation:
                           </p>
                           <ul>
                              <li>
                                 <p>When the document is approved,
                                    it is automatically published. 
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                 <p>You can complete the award and
                                    generate the purchase documents after the award decision has been
                                    approved. 
                                 </p>

                           </ul>
                           <p>Note that approvals tasks are different from collaboration
                              team task assignments (although collaboration team members can also
                              be designated as approvers). Tasks that are assigned to collaboration
                              team members are tracked manually and have no effect on the processing
                              of the negotiation by the application.

                           <p>During both the document approval process and the
                              award approval process, you can monitor the progress of the approvals
                              by viewing the Negotiation Approval Process and the Award Approval

                                    For example, the negotiation line may ask for 1000 units. You may
                                    be required to offer to sell the entire 1000 units, or you may be
                                    able to offer to sell fewer.

                              about your company or your practices. Such questions are called requirements.
                              The Category Manager may have defined such requirements. If they are

                              stops at the top of the page. If responses are required, you must

                              it offline by entering your response information into the spreadsheet.
                              When completed, you import the spreadsheet back to the application.

                              rebid for you when a competitor submits a lower winning bid. The application
                              automatically rebids with a lower price when a competitor submits
                              a winning bid. When you submit your initial bid, you specify a value
                              (percentage of the initial price offered or a flat amount) and the
                              minimum price you are willing to offer. On any subsequent rebids,
                              the offer price is reduced by a value that you can specify. This happens
                              automatically until you reach your minimum price.

                              being offered on all or a subset of negotiation lines by a set amount.
                              This frees you from having to update each line's price individually.

                              and importing responses in negotiation using an XML spreadsheet. Spreadsheets
                              enable suppliers to easily respond to negotiations offline. Spreadsheet
                              import is very useful when dealing with large negotiations having
                              many requirements or lines, or having complex lines with many attributes
                              or price tiers. Spreadsheet processing effectively speeds up the response
                              process by enabling you to enter data into your spreadsheet offline
                              and then import the data in a single operation

                              defined for this negotiation. Some fields appear depending on whether
                              the negotiation outcome is purchase order or purchase agreement. The
                              table below contains descriptions of all possible columns regardless
                              of negotiation outcome.

                              list at the top left of the lines table. You have several options
                              including sorting the lines by line number or using the Custom option
                              to display specific lines.

                           Requirements might ask about certifications your company has achieved.
                           Your answers to requirements can be used by evaluators when considering

                              in the past, your last response is defaulted into the response field.
                              If a requirement response is required, it's identified by an asterisk.

                           bid controls you defined (Proxy Decrement and Proxy Minimum) and the

                           <p>When you submit your initial bid amount, you can enter
                              a number as your proxy decrement. The application considers this as
                              either a fixed amount or as a percentage of the current best bid.
                              Either way, this is the amount used by the application when calculating
                              your next bid price. You also declare the proxy minimum amount, which
                              functions as the floor below which you do not bid.

                           or from a certain location. For example, a seller might ask a certain
                           price for a purchase of a up to nine cases of widgets but offer a
                           lower price for a purchase of more ten or more cases. Price breaks
                           can be cumulative or noncumulative. Noncumulative price breaks apply
                           only to quantity bought on a single release against the agreement.
                           Cumulative price break amounts accumulate over the life of the agreement.

                        <p>The negotiation document author may have asked
                           you to respond to certain important attributes of a particular negotiation
                           line. Such attributes do not deal with price or additional costs of
                           a line, but instead they are concerned with characteristics of the
                           line.

                        <p>Line attributes may be required or optional. If a
                           line attribute is optional, you do not have to respond to it. You
                           must respond to all required attributes. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Line attributes can be used when evaluating responses
                           to a negotiation. Such negotiations are called multiattribute scored
                           negotiations. In multiattribute scored negotiations, all required
                           attributes of type text, number, or date, have a list of acceptable
                           values defined by the negotiation author. When you reply to a required
                           attribute in a multiattribute scored negotiation, you must select
                           your response from the predefined values. You can enter a value for
                           a required attribute of the type URL. If the negotiation is not a
                           multiattribute scored negotiation, there are no lists of acceptable
                           values, and you can enter any value appropriate for the attribute
                           data type. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>The negotiation document author may have defined some
                           additional information you can use when deciding on your response
                           to the line attribute. If the author specifies a target value for
                           a line attribute, she may choose to display the target value. Additionally,
                           in a multiattribute scored negotiation where there are required attributes,
                           the allowable values are assigned a numeric score that indicates that
                           value's desirability. The author may choose to display this information
                           as well. You should check any targets and scores that are displayed
                           when planning your response to the attribute.

                           to communicate the status of deliverables to the purchasing department
                           and to submit any required documents. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>
                           
                           <p>Contract deliverables are created by the buyer as
                              part of the contract negotiations and are listed in the contract terms.
                              Each deliverable includes information about the due date and can automatically
                              notify you before it is due. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>If a particular deliverable is due periodically, then
                              the application creates separate instances for each of the due dates.
                              Such repeating deliverables share the same name but have different
                              due dates. For example, a safety report that is due every month after
                              the contract is signed, results in multiple instances of the same
                              deliverable each with the appropriate due date.

                           Pausing a negotiation does not affect Live Monitor information.  For

                           <p>InFusion Corporation is currently conducting an auction
                              for supplies and services it will use to set up a new West Coast office.
                              Currently there are responses from three suppliers in the auction,
                              two who were originally invited and a third who found the auction
                              during a search. The Category Manager performs the following actions
                              using the Monitor Activities page:
                           </p>
                           <ul>

                                 <p> She wishes to see detailed information
                                    on the second supplier's activity, so she highlights the row in the
                                    Supplier Activities table. The Activities table in the lower half
                                    of the page refreshes with the information on the supplier site(s),
                                    supplier contacts(s), and any activity they have performed on the
                                    negotiation. .

                                 <p>The Category Manager notices that
                                    the uninvited participant has not entered a response. She recognizes
                                    the supplier name and remembers that this supplier has accessed several
                                    negotiations in the recent past without ever responding. She suspects
                                    the supplier has no intention on responding and is only monitoring
                                    the progress of the negotiation to obtain competitive information,
                                    so she locks the supplier, preventing any further access.

                        <p>Suppliers can access your negotiation in different
                           ways: suppliers can find your negotiation by searching online; or
                           you can explicitly invite a supplier to participate. For example,
                           you can research suppliers from the supplier search page and then
                           specifically invite them by adding them to the supplier invitation
                           list while creating the negotiation document. Then when the negotiation
                           is published, invitation notifications are sent to the suppliers you
                           indicated. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Also, you can invite additional suppliers
                           after the negotiation has been published or even if the negotiation
                           has been opened for responding. You might want to invite additional
                           suppliers if the response prices you are receiving are not to your
                           liking, if the responses are not meeting negotiation targets, or if
                           new suppliers contact you and ask to be allowed to participate. When
                           you invite a supplier, you specify a main contact to receive notifications.
                           You can change the main supplier contact at a later time if needed,
                           and you can specify an additional contact if necessary. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the supplier has multiple sites registered,
                           you can optionally identify a single supplier site to participate
                           in the negotiation. If you specify a supplier site as well as a supplier
                           on the invitation, only contacts registered with that supplier site
                           can view and participate in the negotiation. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Some suppliers can be registered in the application
                           but have not yet applied for approval to conduct spend transactions
                           with your buying organization. Such suppliers are called prospective
                           suppliers. You can add these suppliers to your invitation list. They
                           will receive invitations and can view and respond to the negotiation.
                           They cannot be included on purchase documents until they are approved
                           for spend transactions, however allowing prospective suppliers to
                           participate in the negotiation allows their spend authorization requests
                           to be evaluated at the same time that the negotiation is proceeding.

                           when you must  communicate with other internal users (such as members

                           information or clarification. Also, collaboration team members may
                           want to communicate with each other. You can use online messages to
                           communicate online with other participants in your negotiation.

                           An online conversation is organized into one or more message threads,
                           which any of the participants can initiate. You can start communications
                           with other internal users as soon as a draft negotiation is created.
                           After a negotiation is published, you and other internal users can
                           exchange messages with supplier users who are participating in the
                           negotiation.

                              several items. There are several requirements in the negotiation to
                              solicit information about new companies who responded. The negotiation
                              has ended, and June has closed it for responding. She continues evaluating
                              the responses to make her award decisions. The first two requirements
                              deal with company information.

                           and his team of evaluators begin the process of awarding the contract
                           by scoring the supplier responses to the RFQ requirements

                                 to the collaboration team members. Tim notifies the technical evaluators
                                 that they now have access to the supplier responses, and he asks them
                                 to complete their evaluation in a week. At the same time, Tim conducts
                                 his own evaluation of the technical requirements.

                                 scoring, Tim applies the knockout scores for the technical requirements.
                                 The suppliers who remain after the knockout scores are applied proceed
                                 to the next evaluation stage.

                              <p>Tim unseals the technical requirements responses.
                                 This allows suppliers to view their own and other suppliers' responses
                                 to the technical requirements

                                 are available for scoring and assigns them a deadline. Since Tim is
                                 not a commercial evaluator, he does not conduct an evaluation of the
                                 supplier responses or score them.

                        <p>There are several ways you can analyze supplier
                           responses to your negotiation. You can view and analyze responses
                           both while the negotiation is open and receiving responses, and after
                           the negotiation ends. You can also view the Automatic Award Recommendation
                           generated by the application.

                        <p>The Monitor Negotiation page provides you with a centralized
                           location to obtain information about all the responding suppliers
                           and their responses while the negotiation is still open. You can obtain
                           information at the response level, or drill down to the line level.
                           Using the displays available, you can easily view competing responses
                           and spot any trends over time. Also, the Response History page lets
                           you view the responses in the order they were received. If appropriate,
                           you can disqualify any responses from the Response History page. Once
                           you have closed the negotiation, there are many tools and displays
                           available to you to support the analysis of responses.

                                 were defined for the negotiation, automatically scored requirements
                                 have already been assigned scores by the application. If there are
                                 manually scored requirements, you or an authorized member of the collaboration
                                 team can enter scores.

                              <p>If the negotiation is a two stage RFQ, you must evaluate

                                 who pass the technical evaluation, you can evaluate the commercial
                                 responses.

                              <p>Once you have scored your requirements, you can apply
                                 a knockout criteria (if one was defined for the negotiation) to eliminate
                                 any responses which do not meet the minimum score value.

                              <p>By default, all responding suppliers are placed on
                                 the short list. However, you can remove any suppliers from further
                                 award consideration by changing their shortlist status.

                                 using knockout criteria and shortlisting is a good way to reduce the
                                 number of responses for analysis.

                              <p>There are several graphs available to you when making
                                 your award decisions. Some are at the response level, some at the
                                 line level. These displays are updated in real time, allowing you
                                 to enter provisional award decisions and then change the values and
                                 view the new graph results until you obtain the exact decision you
                                 need. For charts that deal with requirement scores, you should enter
                                 values for any manually scored requirements before generating the
                                 charts. For charts that display savings amounts, you should enter
                                 provisional award values first.

                                 the responses offline. You can enter your award decisions into the
                                 spreadsheet and upload it back to the applications. Offline analysis
                                 is useful when there are many negotiation lines to be considered or
                                 there are many supplier responses.

                           <p>Office Supplies, Inc. is conducting an RFQ on several
                              new items they wish to add to their inventory. Mary Wang, the buyer
                              responsible for awarding the negotiation has been checking the responses
                              coming in and is now ready to enter her award decisions
                           </p>
                           <p>Mary closes the negotiation. For one of the negotiation
                              lines, she sees there are many responses, some including alternate
                              lines, so she and other collaboration team members view and score
                              any manually scored requirements.
                           </p>
                           <p>She applies the knockout criteria. This removes most
                              of the supplier responses for this line. She views the list of remaining
                              suppliers and decides that no more suppliers need to be removed, so
                              she does not change any of the remaining suppliers' shortlist status. 
                           </p>
                           <p>For the remaining suppliers, she generates the supplier
                              level displays by selecting the suppliers and clicking <span class="uicontrol">Award</span>. She sees that there is a group of
                              responses that offer substantial savings, but that they are very close
                              in price. She decides to split the award among the suppliers, so she
                              generates the line level displays to decide the best amount to award
                              to each supplier.

                              to contract for IT services for a new mass transit department. The
                              category manager, James Sanchez, creates the two-stage RFQ document.
                              He uses the specifications imparted by the new department head to
                              document the technical specifications in two requirement sections
                              that are identified as technical. He also identifies the financial
                              information required for the legally mandated quote process in a requirement
                              section labeled Commercial. After completing the RFQ document, he
                              publishes the negotiation.

                              requirement sections. Mr. Sanchez shortlists the supplier quotes with
                              the best responses to the technical requirements.
                           </p>
                           <p>Mr. Sanchez then unlocks the commercial requirements.
                              The designated financial evaluators view and score the responses to
                              the financial requirement sections for the shortlisted quotes.

                        <h4>Amending a Negotiation: Worked Example</h4>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can make changes to a negotiation while
                           it is active and receiving responses by creating an amendment. Once
                           you have issued an amendment, notifications of the amendment are sent
                           to all suppliers who were invited and all suppliers who have responded.
                           The suppliers can then view the amendments. Once suppliers view and
                           acknowledge the amendment, they can create a new response to the negotiation. 
                        </p>

                           <p>The original negotiation number is augmented with
                              a suffix to indicate the amended version. For example, if the original
                              negotiation number was 500, the first amended version is numbered
                              500,1. 
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>If a supplier is restricted to a single response and
                              had already responded prior to the amendment, a notification is sent
                              to the supplier. The supplier may view the amendment, acknowledge
                              the changes and submit a new response, in which case it becomes the
                              supplier's new single best response.

                        <p>Your application may use the approval management
                           system to track and manage approvals of both your negotiation document
                           and your award decisions. You can approve the negotiation document,
                           the negotiation award, or both. When approvals are used, internal
                           reviewers view and OK the details of the negotiation document and
                           the final award decision.

                        <div class="sect4" id="OAPRC1220722"><h5 class="topictitle">How Approvals Work</h5>
                           <p>If approvals are enabled, you can have both the negotiation
                              document and the award decision subject to approval before they can
                              be further processed. The Approvals Management Extension is an automated
                              process in which approval checks are passed from a user, a group of
                              users, or the application to another user or group of users for consideration
                              or action. Similarly, after you make an award decision, you can submit
                              it for approval. 
                           </p>
                           <p>When the negotiation document requires approval,
                              you submit the document for approval once you have completed it. When
                              the document has been approved, the application automatically publishes
                              it. The new status for the document depends on the open and preview
                              dates. 
                           </p>

                                 <p>If the open date is Upon Approval,
                                    the status is Active.
                                 </p>

                           <p>For award approval, once the award has been approved,
                              the status changes to Approved, and you can complete the award and
                              generate the purchase documents.
                           </p>
                           <p>Whether a document or award needs approval depends
                              on the approval rules that are defined for the task. For example,
                              a negotiation could be subject to approval because it includes items
                              from a particular category, or an award decision could need approval
                              because the award amount is over a certain limit.
                           </p>
                           <p>While a negotiation document is being approved, the
                              status of the negotiation is Approval in Progress. While the award
                              is being approved, the status is Award Approval in Process. If there
                              is an issue and an approver rejects the document or award, you receive
                              a notification with information about the rejection. You can edit
                              and update the document or award and resubmit it for approval. Once
                              the document or award is approved, the status changes to Approved,
                              and you receive a notification that the approval is successful. Then
                              you can continue processing the negotiation:

                                    it is automatically published.

                              </li>

                                 <p>You can complete the award and
                                    generate the purchase documents after the award decision has been
                                    approved.

                           <p>Note that approvals tasks are different from collaboration
                              team task assignments (although collaboration team members can also
                              be designated as approvers). Tasks that are assigned to collaboration
                              team members are tracked manually and have no effect on the processing
                              of the negotiation by the application.

                           <p>The requisitions with the earliest Need-by Date are
                              allocated first, followed by requisitions with increasingly later
                              Need-by Dates until the required number of units for the line is allocated.
                              If there are requisitions with the same Need-by Date, the requisition
                              with the earlier creation date is allocated first.

                              offer quantity because the negotiation is only for 2000 units).

                        <p>You can break down your award decisions several
                           ways, depending on the responses you receive and the needs of your
                           negotiation. You can award the negotiation and choose to not create
                           a purchase order; however, any backing requisitions not allocated
                           to purchase order lines are returned to the requisition pool.

                           <p>You can easily award all the lines of a negotiation
                              to a single supplier. Awarding at the negotiation level enables you
                              to quickly enter your award specifications since you do not have to
                              enter an explicit award decision for each negotiation line. All the
                              lines on which the supplier quoted or bid are awarded to that supplier.
                              Any lines the supplier did not quote or bid on are not awarded.

                           <p>You can award all the business for a single negotiation
                              line to single supplier. If the supplier offered only a partial response,
                              the supplier is awarded as many units as were quoted or bid on. The
                              remaining units remain not awarded. If there were backing requisitions
                              for the units, they are returned to the requisition pool. If a supplier
                              has submitted alternate lines, you can award business to the alternate
                              lines just like you would to a regular line.

                           <p>If necessary, you can split a line between multiple
                              suppliers. This happens often when none of the responses to a particular
                              line offers to sell the entire quote or bid quantity asked for. For
                              example, if you are looking to buy 100 monitors, and supplier A offers
                              to sell 75 monitors for $300 each, but supplier B offers to sell 60
                              monitors for $250 each, you might want to award supplier B the first
                              60 monitors and award the remaining 40 to supplier A. Note that if
                              you have alternate line responses from the same supplier, you can
                              award the alternate lines just like regular lines. You can therefore
                              split a negotiation line between two different line responses from
                              the same supplier.

                           <p>This file contains the instructions for analyzing
                              and awarding responses in negotiations using an XML spreadsheet. Spreadsheet
                              import is very useful when dealing with large negotiations ( for example,
                              many requirements or many lines) or complex lines (many attributes)
                              and effectively speeds up the response process by allowing you to
                              enter data into your spreadsheet offline and import the entire spreadsheet
                              in a single operation. You can enter award values in the spreadsheet
                              and import to the system using the Import option. The spreadsheet
                              displays only the necessary information for analyzing and awarding
                              responses. You can easily experiment with different award decisions
                              and see how it impacts the overall savings or other award criteria.
                              The spreadsheet does not include all the negotiation details that
                              can be found either online or in the PDF file.
                           </p> 
                           <p>At the top of each worksheet, there are fields displaying negotiation
                              information such as negotiation type, open date, negotiation currency,
                              as well as supplier information and response details.

                           and the Line Summary Worksheet</h5> 
                           <p>The application
                              imports the information entered into the Line Summary Worksheet into
                              the application when processing your award decisions. For straightforward
                              negotiations, for example a simple negotiation, you may wish to enter
                              your award values directly into the Line Summary Worksheet. 
                           </p> 
                           <p>For more complex negotiations however, for example large
                              negotiations with many additional aspects (cost factors, line attributes,
                              price breaks), you may wish to use the Lines Worksheet. You can use
                              the Lines Worksheet to perform in-depth analysis using the additional
                              supplier response values. For example, you can perform what-if analysis,
                              side-by-side comparison, and additional award and savings calculations
                              that are only available on the Lines Worksheet. You can enter and
                              adjust award quantities to see the effect on the award total. 
                           </p> 
                           <p>As you enter award quantities into the Lines Worksheet,
                              the values are automatically copied up into the Line Summary Worksheet,
                              so once you determine your award quantity amounts using the Lines
                              Worksheet, you do not have to reenter the values in the Line Summary
                              Worksheet for uploading into the application.  
                           </p> 
                           <p>Note that if you enter values directly into a field in the Line Summary
                              Worksheet, the formula to copy that field's values from the Lines
                              Worksheet is erased.

                              defined for the negotiation lines as well as information for any responses
                              on those lines. The worksheet name will specify the range of lines
                              it contains. The Line Summary has entries for each regular line, lot,
                              group, and group line. It does not contain entries for lot lines.
                              In Line Summary table, for each negotiation line, multiple rows are
                              displayed, one for each response received for the negotiation, even
                              though that response may not have responded to that particular line.

                              worksheet, but be aware that if you enter award information in the
                              Line Summary worksheet directly, any award information on the Lines
                              worksheet will not be copied automatically to the Line Summary worksheet
                              for upload.

                              by the category manager. Following the Target column, there are columns
                              displaying the suppliers' responses side by side for easy comparison.

                              suppliers defined any of their own price breaks, there will be rows

                           a purchase order; however, any backing requisitions not allocated
                           to purchase order lines are returned to the requisition pool.

                              to a single supplier. Awarding at the negotiation level enables you
                              to quickly enter your award specifications since you do not have to
                              enter an explicit award decision for each negotiation line. All the
                              lines on which the supplier quoted or bid are awarded to that supplier.
                              Any lines the supplier did not quote or bid on are not awarded.

                              units remain not awarded. If there were backing requisitions for the
                              units, the requisition units that were not awarded are returned to
                              the requisition pool.

                              suppliers. This happens often when none of the responses to a particular
                              line offers to sell the entire quantity asked for. For example, if
                              you are looking to buy 100 monitors, and supplier A offers to sell
                              75 monitors for $300 each, but supplier B offers to sell 60 monitors
                              for $250 each, you might want to award supplier B the first 60 monitors
                              and award the remaining 40 to supplier A.

                                 a single supplier or split a line between multiple suppliers by selecting
                                 the suppliers for award and entering the awarded quantity for each

                        <p>Vision Enterprise has just finished conducting
                           a negotiation on computer supplies it needs to open a new office in
                           Denver. It has received responses from several suppliers. Some of
                           the suppliers are new but several are incumbent suppliers who have
                           worked with Vision Enterprises for many years. The range of prices
                           offered in the responses varies widely in some cases, and additionally,
                           since the negotiation did not require total unit amount to be offered,
                           several suppliers offered to sell only partial line amounts. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>In this scenario, since the offers for the lines have
                           varied so widely, you have decided to award the negotiation to multiple
                           suppliers. To do that, you must award each line individually, and
                           must decide how to award each line among the suppliers who have responded.
                           The table below shows the prices offered for an office deck. The negotiation
                           document asked for the supplier to sell 10 desks at $250 each.

                        <p>Vision Enterprise has just finished conducting
                           a negotiation on computer supplies it needs to open a new office in
                           Denver. It has received responses from several suppliers. Some of
                           the suppliers are new but several are incumbent suppliers who have
                           worked with Vision Enterprises for many years. The range of prices
                           offered in the responses varies widely in some cases, and additionally,
                           since the negotiation did not require total unit amount to be offered,
                           several suppliers offered to sell only partial line amounts. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>In this scenario, since the offers for the lines have
                           varied so widely, you have decided to award the negotiation to multiple
                           suppliers. To do that, you must award each line individually, and
                           must decide how to award each line among the suppliers who have responded.
                           The table below shows the prices offered for an office deck. The negotiation
                           document asked for the supplier to sell 10 desks at $250 each.

                              effect, the recommendation is based on price/score). No additional
                              response adjustments such as cost factors, manually scored header
                              requirements, or price breaks are considered.

                           are still responding. After you have closed the negotiation to responding,

                           weighted or automatically scored requirements or line attributes.
                           It does not consider the effects of any supplier responses to any

                              line 2 contains a different value for Requisition BU. The negotiation
                              line 3 is not backed with a requisition and it does not contain values
                              for Taxation Country and Document Fiscal Classification. Due to these
                              conditions, two purchase orders are created, where the first purchase
                              order contains the negotiation lines 1 and 3, and the second purchase
                              order contains the negotiation line 2.

                              line 3 is not backed with a requisition and it does not contain values
                              for Taxation Country and Document Fiscal Classification. Due to these
                              conditions, three purchase orders are created with each purchase order
                              corresponding to a negotiation line.

                           <p>The negotiation lines 1 and 2 contain different values for Document
                              Fiscal Classification. The negotiation lines 3 and 4 are not backed
                              with requisitions and do not contain values for Taxation. If a negotiation
                              line backed with a requisition does not participate in allocation,
                              it is treated as a sourcing line and is combined with existing purchase
                              order where other sourcing lines are present. If sourcing lines are
                              not present in this negotiation, then that negotiation line is combined
                              with the existing order only if there is a single purchase for a Requisition
                              BU, Sold-to Legal Entity, and Response number.  If there are multiple
                              purchase orders for this combination because of the difference in
                              tax attributes, then this requisition line will form a different purchase
                              order.

                           <p>The awarded quantity for line 1 is 10 but
                              allocated quantity is 5 for both Response 1 and Response 2. The additional
                              allocated quantity of 5 is treated as sourcing line. The allocated
                              quantity for negotiation line 2 is 0 and therefore it is treated as
                              a sourcing line similar to lines 3 and 4. Since only the negotiation
                              line 1 is considered requisition based line having taxation attributes,
                              for Response 1, lines 2 and 3 are combined with line 1 into PO1 and
                              for Response 2, lines 2 and 4 are combined with line 1 into PO2.

                           the awarded lines are grouped together to create one or more purchasing
                           documents. How these lines are grouped depends on whether a supply
                           chain financial orchestration agreement is in effect for the line
                           (and if so, the values for the supply chain financial orchestration
                           agreement attributes) as well as the values for typical grouping attributes.

                        <p>Global procurement is a procurement strategy wherein
                           a central buying organization buys goods from suppliers on behalf
                           of one more internal organization. The supplier liability is borne
                           by the purchasing organization. The purchasing and requesting organizations
                           settle the financial transaction among themselves. The financial route
                           is the route in which these financial transactions are settled. This
                           can be different from the physical route and involve one or more intermediary
                           nodes forming part of the route. The intermediary nodes are internal
                           organizations that are not part of the physical supply chain transaction
                           but are part of the financial route. How these transactions are routed
                           among the internal nodes is specified and controlled by supply chain
                           financial organization agreements.
