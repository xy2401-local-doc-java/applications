                        how granular companies wish to approve and track authorized supply
                        sources. Each entry can have supplier-item or supplier-category ordering

                        <p>Procurement business units are responsible

                           and administration. Approved supplier list entries can be created
                           at a procurement BU level or for a specific ship-to organization within
                           a procurement BU.

                        <p>Scope is primarily about what level in the
                           buying organization you are tracking authorized suppliers. A scope
                           of Global allows the ASL entry to be used or enforced by all ship-to
                           organizations that roll up to the requisitioning BU or BUs for which
                           the procurement BU is a service provider.

                        <p>Scope also has to do with how you define multiple
                           attribute sets for different ship-to organizations.  When an approved

                           or BUs for which the procurement BU is a service provider will reference
                           the global attribute set. When an approved supplier list entry is
                           defined as <span class="uicontrol">Ship-to Organization</span>, you create an attribute set for one specific ship-to organization.

                           by specifying the type. When an approved supplier list entry is defined
                           as <span class="uicontrol">Item</span>, you are associating the
                           entry to a particular catalog item. When an approved supplier list

                           you are associating the entry to a particular procurement category. Using category
                           type allows you to manage the supplier relationship for whole a set
                           of items that roll up to the category.

                        <p>When you begin a business relationship with
                           a supplier, the supplier usually has a provisional status. For a provisional
                           supplier, the amount of information you need is typically minimal.
                           You need more information for suppliers with whom you conduct financial
                           transaction. The level of review and oversight needed for a potential
                           supplier is also typically less than that required by a contracted
                           supplier.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>An efficient way of addressing the need for different
                           levels of supplier information is to provide two statuses for the
                           suppliers. The provisional status allows a restricted level of access
                           to the application capabilities. The full status allows access to
                           a more complete range of capabilities.

                           <p>Suppliers can ask to be registered with the application
                              either independently by accessing the buying company's registration
                              web page, or they can be registered internally, for example, a category
                              manager can request to register a new supplier when completing an
                              invitation list for a new negotiation. In either case, the registration
                              requests go to the supplier manager for review. Once the supplier
                              manager approves the registration request, the supplier becomes a
                              prospective supplier in the application. Prospective suppliers have
                              a restricted level of access. They can participate in supplier qualification
                              initiatives, and they can view and respond to negotiations. Prospective
                              suppliers are identified within the application by an icon that indicates
                              their prospective status.
                           </p>

                           <h5 class="topictitle">Spend Authorized Suppliers</h5>
                           
                           <p>If the category manager decides to award business
                              to a prospective supplier who responded to a negotiation, that supplier
                              needs to be authorized in the application to conduct spend transactions
                              with the buying organization before a purchase document can be created
                              for that supplier. Spend authorization requires a more complete level
                              of information about the supplier and is subject to approval by the
                              supplier manager. Once the supplier is approved for spend operations,
                              they have access to all the normal capabilities of the application.

                           <p>Prospective suppliers are provisional suppliers that
                              are newly registered with the application. These suppliers have not
                              been authorized to conduct spend operations with the buying organization.
                              You can award business to prospective suppliers, but before the  award
                              can be completed, any prospective suppliers must be spend authorized
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>When you complete your award decision, if any business
                              has been awarded to prospective suppliers, the negotiation moves to
                              Award Completion in Progress. The application sends a request to the
                              supplier manager to authorize the supplier for spend operations. Once
                              the supplier is spend authorized, an entry appears in the Recent Activity
                              table in your workbench notifying you that the supplier is now spend
                              authorized. Also, a notification is sent to the original requester
                              of the spend authorization (note that if the supplier was already
                              in the process of being authorized when you made your award decision,
                              the application does not consider you the original authorization
                              requester, and you won't receive this notification)

                           <p>You must monitor your Recent Activity table to know
                              when the spend authorization requests have been processed. Once all
                              the prospective suppliers who have been awarded business for a negotiation
                              are spend authorized, you can create the purchase documents for that
                              negotiation.
                           </p>

                              shows up in your Recent Activity table and you receive a notification
                              (if you are the originating requester). The status for the negotiation
                              reverts back to its previous status, either Award in Progress or Award
                              Approved.

                     <p>A supplier is modeled as a global entity,
                        meaning it is not created within a business unit or any other organizational
                        context. A procurement
                        business unit establishes a relationship with a supplier through
                        the creation of a site which maintains internal controls for how procure
                        to pay transactions are executed with the supplier. The other entities
                        of the supplier profile capture mostly external information that is
                        provided by the supplier, such as tax identifiers, addresses, contact
                        information, and so on.

                        that are maintained for a supplier and how they are organized.

                                 maintenance in either entity. One address can be associated to one
                                 or more contacts, and one contact can be associated to one or more
                                 addresses. Additionally, when a contact is associated with an address,
                                 it is implicitly associated with all sites using the address. This
                                 establishes the concept of a Site Contact. Some transactions, such
                                 as purchasing documents, allow for a Site Contact to be selected on
                                 the transaction.

                           as prospective business partners which prevents them from engaging

                           customer service representatives to access orders and agreements.
                           The corporation also wants the Supplier Self Service Administrator
                           to provision the supplier customer service representatives. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The IT security manager navigates to the Manage Supplier
                           User Roles page. They locate it in the Setup and Maintenance work
                           area, Procurement offering, Supplier Portal functional area, Manage
                           Supplier User Roles task. They search for the supplier job role Supplier

                        </p>
                        <p>The Procurement Application Administrator navigates
                           to the Manage Supplier User Role Usages page. For the Supplier Customer

                           Default for Supplier Portal, and Allow Supplier to Provision.

                           receipts, invoices and payments information by default.

                        <p>The Procurement Application Administrator navigates
                           to the Manage Supplier User Roles page. They select the Allow Supplier
                           to Provision option for all supplier roles in the table. This allows
                           the Supplier Self Service Administrator to provision users with these
                           roles in the Supplier Portal.

                           it must be controlled by Vision Corporation. The IT Security Manager
                           adds the Supplier Bidder role to the table. For the newly added role,

                           is responsible for supplier numbering setup. Suppliers created through
                           the Create Supplier task flow, through the supplier registration process,
                           or supplier import are automatically numbered using a numeric sequence.
                           The starting supplier number is defined in the Specify Supplier Numbering
                           setup page (the predefined default number is 1). The supplier number
                           then increments automatically as numbers are assigned during supplier
                           creation.

                        <p>Additionally, the next supplier number can be updated
                           at any time, not just during initial setup, if for example there's
                           ever a need to skip a range of supplier numbers.  The application
                           validates that the number is not already used.

                           to avoid adding duplicate suppliers. The matching engine is supported
                           by the Oracle Fusion Enterprise Data Quality application which can
                           perform matching checks against all external parties.

                           and exact name matches. For example, if a company exists as a customer,
                           the user is informed so they can decide if the party can be used as
                           a supplier. If selected the existing party is used to establish the
                           supplier.

                        <p>Business classifications support the tracking
                           of supplier certifications that are important to companies for different
                           reasons, such as for supplier diversity programs. Since classification
                           requirements can vary by country or region the seeded classifications
                           can be changed. The business classifications table can capture multiple
                           certificates belonging to the same business classification that were
                           issued by different certifying agencies. Classification attributes
                           that can be captured include Certifying Agency, Certificate, Start
                           Date, and Expiration Date. In addition, attachments and notes can
                           be captured for each classification record.

                           setup page. The Manage Certifying Agencies setup page helps to maintain

                           Category Hierarchy page enables the buying organization to define
                           a category hierarchy for identifying the products and services categories
                           that suppliers and prospective suppliers can provide.

                           The hierarchy navigation allows supplier users to quickly drill down
                           and select their applicable categories. When a parent category is
                           selected, the buying organization assumes that the supplier can provide

                           that parent category.

                              the supplier might require more restrictive receipt and invoice tolerances.

                                          purposes reflect the sales functions which the supplier claims to
                                          perform at their location, whereas the site purpose indicates the
                                          equivalent procurement functions the buying organization transacts
                                          with the location, which can be a subset of the address purposes.

                           <p>Site assignments control which client BUs can transact
                              with the site. In addition, the sold-to BU associated with
                              the client BU is defined. Sold-to BU represents the organization that
                              assumes the liability for the purchases made on behalf of the client
                              BU. In most cases, the client BU and the sold-to BU are the same.
                              However, users can set up a different sold-to BU for a specific client
                              if required.

                           <p>The premise of the site assignment model is to leverage
                              the centralized procurement organization which negotiates terms and
                              sets policy controls. These terms and controls established for a supplier
                              site are used by the client BUs as a result of being assigned to the
                              site. Without the site assignment model each client BU would be forced
                              to establish its own relationship with the supplier. The service provider
                              relationship between the client BU and procurement BU is defined in
                              the business unit setup.

                           <p>There are two ways to create site assignments. Manually
                              create one at a time by selecting the specific client BU, or autocreate. 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Every supplier site must have an active assignment
                              to create transactions against the site, such as purchase orders or
                              invoices. In other words, if a site assignment does not exist or is
                              inactive, you cannot create transactions for that supplier site.

                                 <p>Client BU: Select the appropriate

                                    serviced by the procurement BU.

                                 <p>Sold-to BU: If the selected BU performs
                                    invoicing, then the same BU can be used as the Sold-to BU. However,
                                    in certain instances due to tax or legal reasons the client BU may
                                    only perform requisitioning with the supplier and another BU assumes
                                    the liability for the purchases. In this case a different sold-to
                                    BU is selected. The list of sold-to BUs that can be selected for a
                                    given client BU is determined by the Intercompany Transaction Flow
                                    setup. In addition, when a separate Sold-to BU acts as an agent to
                                    the client BU an assignment must be created for the sold-to BU in
                                    order for the BU to process invoices.

                           <p>To use Oracle B2B e-Commerce Gateway, you must first
                              configure the application to receive or send XML documents for a supplier
                              site. The B2B administrator can set up Oracle B2B e-Commerce Gateway
                              using the Configure Oracle B2B e-Commerce Gateway Setups task. You
                              can find the task in the Setup and Maintenance work area.  The B2B
                              Supplier Site Code must be unique across suppliers, but can be the
                              same across sites within a supplier. Oracle Fusion Purchasing uses
                              the B2B Supplier Site Code to determine if a purchase order must be
                              communicated through B2B communication. You cannot communicate attachments
                              with purchase orders or change orders using Oracle B2B e-Commerce
                              Gateway.

                           <p>Similarly, you must configure the supplier site to
                              communicate with Oracle B2B e-Commerce Gateway. To configure the supplier
                              site, use the Sites tab from the Manage Suppliers page. When you configure
                              a supplier site for B2B transactions, you define the supplier site
                              as a trading partner in Oracle e-Commerce B2B Gateway.

                           being successfully merged. Supplier sites can be merged within the
                           same supplier or between two suppliers. Additionally, the supplier
                           merge process results in updates to transactions when the site is
                           referenced on an order, for example, is merged to another site.

                     <p>Supplier user provisioning refers to the
                        process of establishing supplier users with access to Oracle Fusion
                        Supplier Portal (Supplier Portal). Your buying organization can create
                        and maintain user accounts, job roles, and data access controls for
                        supplier contacts. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The content supplier users can access, and tasks
                        they can perform, are controlled by your buying organization. You
                        can also allow supplier users to assume the responsibility for user
                        account management on behalf of your buying organization. To do this,
                        allow trusted supplier users to create and maintain user accounts
                        for their fellow employees that require access to the Supplier Portal.
                        Your buying organization can maintain control, and reduce their administrative
                        burden, by granting provisioning access to their trusted suppliers.

                                 of new spend authorized suppliers into the supply base. In smaller

                           two actions are performed by two different job roles: IT Security
                           Manager, and Procurement Application Administrator.

                                 be granted to supplier users in Supplier Portal provisioning flows.
                                 Only the IT Security Manager job role can add and remove roles. This
                                 helps your organization avoid the risk of adding an internal application
                                 job role inadvertently. It prevents suppliers from gaining unauthorized
                                 access to internal data. The supplier roles are added from the central
                                 Oracle LDAP roles repository which stores all Oracle Fusion application
                                 job roles. Once they add a role to the table, the role is immediately
                                 available for provisioning to supplier contacts by the Supplier Administrator.

                                 The Procurement Application Administrator is responsible for this
                                 setup task. They manage settings for how the supplier job roles are
                                 exposed in provisioning flows. The first column controls whether a
                                 supplier job role can be provisioned in Supplier Portal, by supplier
                                 users with the SSA role.

                        <p>The IT Security Manager can also set supplier role
                           usages, as they can access all functions on the setup page. However,
                           this task is typically performed by the Procurement Application Administrator.
                           The Procurement Application Administrator cannot add or remove roles
                           from the table.

                        <p>Your buying organization can establish default roles
                           which expedite supplier user account requests. To do this, identify
                           the minimum set of job roles that a supplier contact can be granted.
                           This prevents approvers from having to explicitly review and assign
                           job roles for each user account request.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When the role default setup is done correctly, the
                           Supplier Administrator (or approver) can review supplier contact user
                           account requests. This allows them to: 
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>

                        This determines which transactions the user can access for the specific
                        business objects their job role is associated with. The two levels
                        of data security are: Supplier and Supplier Site. By default, all
                        supplier user accounts start with Supplier level, meaning they can
                        access all transactions belonging to their supplier company only.
                        For more restrictive access, the Supplier Site level limits user access
                        to transactions for specific supplier sites only.

                           <p>You can create a question that restricts the supplier
                              to selecting from a list of acceptable values. When you create the
                              question, you also specify the values you accept for the question.
                              You can specify a preferred value and optionally display the preferred
                              value to the responder. When the supplier answers the question, she
                              must select a value from the list you provide. You can allow the supplier
                              to select only a single value, or select multiple values from the
                              list. If you use a supplier profile attribute that has a set of possible
                              values defined in the supplier profile, those values become the allowable
                              response values for your question. You cannot change these values,
                              For each allowed response, you can also indicate whether the supplier
                              can include attachments in the response.

                           <p>The Supplier Profile is a standardized collection
                              of attributes that is used by the application to define a supplier.
                              Some examples include information such as corporate or tax information
                              about the supplier. You can reference these attributes as question
                              fields. When a supplier provides information for the field, and the
                              qualification manager accepts the response, the value is used to update
                              the supplier's profile. 
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           <p>Categories of business classifications are also used
                              to describe the supplier, and a hierarchy of products and services
                              that identify a supplier's products or services. Depending on which
                              attribute you map to, values for Question Type and Response Type are
                              defaulted and cannot be changed. If there are multiple possible values
                              defined for the attribute in the supplier profile, those values comprise
                              the acceptable values for the question. You cannot add or delete values
                              to this list.
                           </p>
                           
                           
                           
                           <p>For example, one of the supplier profile attributes
                              is Payment Terms, and there may be several different types of payment
                              terms available. If you use Payment Terms in a question, your responder
                              must select an answer from the list of values.

                           <p>In addition to providing the supplier with a choice
                              of allowable values for a single question, you can also use the supplier's
                              response to an initial question to determine whether additional questions
                              should be asked. This is called question branching. In essence, if
                              you select a particular value for a question, you may be prompted
                              to answer an additional question.

                              of the question). If you modify an existing question, the application
                              assigns a new version number. Any existing responses continue to be
                              associated with the previous version. To synchronize your qualifications
                              and assessments with the new initiative version, you must create a

                              a revised qualification area.

                           <p>Category Managers use Oracle Fusion Sourcing
                              to conduct negotiations with suppliers to determine the best provider
                              for goods and services. These negotiations include information on
                              the negotiated items, but may also solicit company, licensing, performance
                              history and other information from the suppliers participating in
                              the negotiation. Category Managers identify such information by adding
                              questions (called requirements) to the negotiations they then conduct
                              with suppliers. Since this can be the same information you can obtain
                              by using Supplier Qualification questions, Category Managers can copy
                              existing questions from the question library as requirements.

                                 on whether the company is less than one year old. If the company is
                                 older than one year, the resulting question will prompt for an age
                                 value. If the company is not yet a year old, the resulting question
                                 will prompt for a list of key investors. To define this question branching,
                                 Clare must define the test question first, so she clicks the <span class="uicontrol">Add</span> icon for Acceptable Values. She must
                                 add an entry for each of the possible values.

                                 an existing question called More Than One Year. This question is a
                                 simple text box that prompts the supplier to enter a number.

                        <p>Question branching is a tool you can use
                           to expand your qualification possibilities when soliciting information
                           from responders. Branching allows you to selectively pose additional
                           questions depending on a supplier's answer to a prior question. For
                           example, your initial question could ask a supplier to identify any
                           industry trade organizations to which the supplier belongs. Then depending
                           on which organization the supplier selects, you might follow up with
                           questions about the length of membership, level or participation,
                           and if they have received any awards, and if so, attach documentation.

                        <p>When creating a branching question, you create the
                           lower level questions first. Once your lower level questions are created,
                           you can then create your initial question. As you are creating your
                           initial question, and you are specifying its allowable answers, for
                           the appropriate answers, you can search and select the follow-up question
                           you defined previously.

                           branching in simple questions. In each example, the supplier qualification
                           manager creates a primary question and then one or more follow-up
                           questions  which are displayed depending on the answer to the primary

                           <p>Tim Jones is creating a question for use in later
                              qualification initiatives. This question asks the supplier to identify
                              whether the company is public or private. It allows a single answer.
                              If the answer to the question is "public," the supplier must answer
                              an additional question which asks the supplier to specify the date
                              the company went public.  If the answer to the question is "private,"
                              the supplier does not need to supply any additional information.

                              supplier. The supplier selects all the certifications from the list
                              that apply to the supplier company. Depending on which certification
                              the supplier selects, an additional question is displayed which prompts
                              the supplier for the latest certification date.

                        <p>The Supplier Profile is a standardized collection
                           of attributes that is used by the application to define a supplier.
                           Some example attributes include information such as corporate, tax
                           information, addresses values, and site usages about the supplier.
                           You can reference these attributes as question fields. When a supplier
                           provides information for the field, and the qualification manager
                           accepts the response, the value is used to update the supplier's profile. 
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Depending on which supplier attribute you map to,
                           values for Question Type and Response Type are defaulted and cannot
                           be changed. If there are multiple possible values defined for the
                           attribute in the supplier profile, those values comprise the acceptable
                           values for the question. You can delete values from the list, but
                           you cannot add values. Any changes you make only affect the values
                           used in the question, not in the underlying values in the supplier
                           profile.

                        <p> There are also attributes that are categories of
                           values such as business classifications used to describe the supplier,
                           and a hierarchy of products and services used to identify a supplier's
                           products or services offerings. These attributes are frequently used
                           in qualification questions. Questions using Products and Services
                           attributes are typically used as branch questions. Questions using
                           Business Classification attributes cannot have any branch questions.

                        <p>Qualification areas are containers for your
                           questions. You use a qualification area and its questions to evaluate
                           a particular aspect of a supplier. You add one or more qualification
                           areas to an initiative and use the questions in the qualification
                           areas to create a questionnaire. You then  send the questionnaire
                           to the supplier and any internal responders for a response. Once all
                           the responders have submitted replies, you and any other evaluators
                           review the answers. If all evaluators approve the responses, a qualification
                           for the supplier is created for that qualification area.

                           have been updated, the questions are displayed  with an alert icon,
                           and you are prompted to revise the qualification area definition by
                           clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Uptake Latest Revision</span>. If you do not update the qualification area definition, it uses
                           the previous version of the question.

                           <p>Category Managers use Oracle Fusion Sourcing
                              to conduct negotiations with suppliers to determine the best provider
                              for goods and services. These negotiations include information on
                              the negotiated items, but may also solicit company, licensing, performance
                              history and other information from the suppliers participating in
                              the negotiation. Category Managers identify such information by adding
                              questions (called requirements) to the negotiations they then conduct
                              with suppliers. Since this can be the same information you can obtain
                              by using qualification areas in initiatives, Fusion Supplier Qualification
                              Management allows Category Managers to copy existing qualification
                              areas as requirement sections in their negotiations. Any qualification
                              areas used in the negotiations must also be defined for the same procurement
                              BU or defined as global.

                           or you can add one or more qualification areas directly to qualification

                                 earlier and is typically used by all her basic supplier qualification

                        <p>Qualification models are containers for qualification
                           areas. You use a qualification model and its qualification areas to
                           perform a comprehensive evaluation of a supplier known as an assessment.
                           When creating an assessment initiative, you specify a single qualification
                           model containing one or more qualification areas. The questions contained
                           in the model's qualification areas are used to create the questionnaire
                           that is sent to your suppliers and any internal responders. The application
                           creates draft qualifications and assessments when you launch the initiative.

                           the qualification area definition displays with an alert icon, and
                           you are prompted to revise the qualification model definition, by
                           clicking <span class="uicontrol">Uptake Latest Revision</span>. If you do not update the qualification model definition, it uses
                           the previous version of the qualification area definition.

                           back to responders. The responders can update their responses and
                           resubmit. Once you view and accept a supplier's questionnaire responses
                           as well as any internal questionnaires responses associated with the
                           supplier, all qualifications for that supplier are in Ready for Evaluation
                           status. During the evaluation step, the designated reviewers view
                           the supplier responses and assign an outcome value. When all qualifications
                           are evaluated and finalized, corresponding assessment becomes active.

                           for that supplier as well as a qualification for the supplier for
                           each qualification area.

                                 associated with the model, she notes that the Qualification Model

                                 start going out 30 days before the assessment expires.

                                 is typically used by all supplier qualification initiatives.

                                 she needs for this model have already been defined so she does not
                                 create any new ones.

                           qualification and assessment outcome in many ways when performing
                           procurement activities.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can have two kinds of initiatives - qualification
                           initiatives and assessment initiatives. Qualification initiatives
                           are used to evaluate a particular function, capability or aspect of
                           a supplier. For example, you might want to view all certifications
                           a supplier has.  Or you might want to examine the quality control
                           procedures or environmental protection history for a supplier. Once
                           you create a qualification initiative, a qualification for that particular
                           aspect of the supplier is created. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Assessment initiatives provide a more thorough and
                           comprehensive evaluation of the supplier. Assessment initiatives evaluate
                           the supplier in both discrete areas, but also at the supplier level.
                           After you launch the initiative, you create one or more qualifications
                           for particular aspects of the supplier (as mentioned above), but you
                           also create an overall, general assessment for the supplier. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You build you Initiative using setup objects that
                           are already predefined in the system:

                           <p>Questions are the fundamental building blocks for
                              your supplier qualifications process. You create a repository of questions
                              from which you can draw to create qualification areas. Then you use
                              the qualification areas to  build the initiatives you use for qualifying
                              your suppliers. The questions in your repository are reusable and
                              available to other supplier qualification managers. By using predefined
                              questions, you can quickly build your initiatives without having to
                              redefine commonly used questions. Questions can apply at the supplier
                              level or at the supplier site level.

                           <p>Qualification areas are containers for your questions.
                              When you create a qualification area, you specify the questions it
                              includes. You use a qualification area and its questions to evaluate
                              a particular aspect of a supplier. When you create a qualification
                              area, you specify which questions it contains and the possible outcomes
                              that can result from a supplier's response to those questions, for
                              example, exceptional/satisfactory/unsatisfactory, or high/low. You
                              add one or more qualification areas at the latest revision to create
                              a qualification initiative. Then you send the initiative's questionnaire
                              to the supplier (any internal responders receive a different internal
                              questionnaire) for a response. Once the responders for a specific
                              supplier or supplier site have submitted replies and those have been
                              accepted, you and any other evaluator can view the answers.

                           <p>Qualification models are containers for qualification
                              areas. When you create a qualification model, you specify the qualification
                              areas it includes. You use a qualification model and its qualification
                              areas to perform a comprehensive evaluation of a supplier called an
                              assessment. You create an assessment initiative by identifying the
                              qualification model to be used. Once responders begin submitting replies,
                              you can view and accept them. Once you have accepted the responses,
                              you and any other reviewers can evaluate the answers.

                           <p>A questionnaire is a vehicle used for collecting
                              data from the supplier and any internal responders. You can customize
                              your questionnaire by removing any nonrequired questions. You can
                              also change the order of the questions, or move them between sections.
                              There is a supplier version that contains the questions for the supplier
                              responders and an internal version that contains questions for internal
                              responders (if any).

                              plan the structure of the initiative. If it is a qualification initiative,
                              you should identify the qualification areas that you include. If it
                              is an assessment initiative, you identify the appropriate qualification
                              model.

                              you are creating a qualification or an assessment initiative. Specify
                              the title for your initiative. Also select the procurement BU that
                              owns the initiative. Once you select a procurement BU, you can only
                              see qualification areas and models that are accessible by this procurement
                              BU as well as any global models and areas.

                           <p>On the Edit Initiative page, you identify the qualification
                              model and  qualification areas, the evaluators of the initiative,
                              and the date by which the evaluation must be completed. You also specify
                              the responders (both supplier and internal) you are targeting for
                              the initiative. Also, you can assign an owner for the initiative (by

                              model, set a date by which the evaluation must be completed, and an
                              owner for the assessment.

                              qualification and an evaluation due date. If the qualification area
                              contains branching questions, you can view the branches by clicking

                              the suppliers you want to evaluate using this initiative. If you want
                              the initiative to apply to a particular supplier site, you can specify
                              the site. Finally, you specify a contact at the supplier or supplier
                              site to receive notifications (if you specified a supplier site, you
                              only see contacts for that site). If you included internal questions
                              in the initiative, you must define an internal responder.

                              of the questionnaires. If you have all required questions previously
                              answered, the previous answers are carried over and the application
                              does not send the questionnaire (although you can choose to send the
                              questionnaire again if you want). You can optionally choose to send
                              questionnaires that have optional questions. When required questions
                              were not answered previously, the questionnaires are automatically
                              sent once the initiative is launched.

                           using supplier attributes. On the Supplier Search page, you select
                           the supplier attributes you want to search on and then provide the
                           attribute values for your search. The more attributes you select,
                           the more restrictive the search. You must specify values for at least
                           one of the fields identified by the double asterisks. Use the information
                           in the table to decide which attributes to include in your search.

                           has recently opened new sites in Canada and Mexico and several new
                           suppliers have registered with her company. Rana's manager, Emily
                           Tao has asked her to qualify them for possible procurement activities
                           in the future so Rana creates an initiative to do so.

                                 from the supplier basic information about the company, its current
                                 set of customers, and its main shipping and distribution setup. Internal

                                 need more time to complete the Existing Customer Base questions, so

                                 so Rana identifies Loraine as the responder for each supplier.

                                 responder. Rana's manager has notified her that a new employee, Jim
                                 March is going to be the qualification manager for suppliers in the
                                 Northwest region. Since one of the suppliers for this initiative is
                                 located in Tacoma Washington, she changes the qualification owner
                                 for that supplier to Jim. Rana continue to own the remaining qualifications.
                                 She clicks the Questionnaire train stop.

                              <p>She enters a supplier questionnaire due date that
                                 is two weeks before the qualification evaluation due date that she
                                 entered on the Overview page. She also enters an instruction: " Please
                                 respond to this questionnaire by the indicated due date." Setting
                                 the date shown to the supplier prior to her actual intended evaluation
                                 date ensures that most of the responses arrive in time for a thorough
                                 evaluation.

                                 in the Supply Chain Information section of the questionnaire asking
                                 "In what countries do you have distribution centers?" This question
                                 is not appropriate for her initiative since she already knows the
                                 countries in which the companies operate, so she deletes it from the
                                 questionnaire

                           goods and services, current certifications, or past transaction history.
                           Once you have this information, you can evaluate the supplier and
                           document their suitability by completing qualifications or an assessment.

                           As responses to your initiative are submitted by the responders, entries

                              is close to expiration. He views the qualification and edits the end
                              date so that it extends for another six months. He can successfully
                              extend the qualification date because there are no PennyPack Systems
                              qualifications in the future with which the extension would overlap.

                              she checks on this, she notices that there is a subsequent Environmental
                              Certification for Allied Plastics does not begin until 60 days from
                              today. So that the qualifications will not lapse between the expiration
                              of the current qualification and the beginning of the subsequent qualification,
                              she accesses the future qualification and moves the start date back
                              30 days so the current qualification will end 30 days from today and
                              the subsequent qualification will begin the next day.

                              for Blue Semiconductors. When he views the assessment information,
                              he notices in addition to the current assessment's upcoming expiration
                              date, that the next assessment doesn't begin until 60 days after this
                              assessment's end date. Carlos decided to modify the assessment end
                              date so that its expiration is right before the beginning of the future

                              the qualification details page, and chooses to revise the qualification.
                              He views the new responses. He chooses to uptake the new responses.
                              Also, because the new responses are more favorable, he chooses to
                              update the Outcome value for the qualification. Finally, since there

                              Viability for Seven Corporation. The new qualification uses the same
                              revision of the qualification area as the expired qualification. She
                              wants to update the assessment with the new qualification.

                              and he must requalify the supplier. He views the Manage Qualifications
