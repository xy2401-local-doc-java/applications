                     <p>Oracle Fusion Purchasing provides the following
                        purchase order types: purchase order, blanket purchase agreement,
                        and contract purchase agreement.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Note that your organization can change the
                        names of these documents to suit your business needs, but in their
                        basic form the following describes their function:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Purchase Order</p>
                           <p>You generally create a purchase order for a one-time purchase of
                              various items. You create a purchase order when you know the details
                              of the goods or services that you require, estimated costs, quantities,
                              delivery schedules, and accounting distributions.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Blanket Purchase Agreement</p>
                           <p>You create blanket purchase agreements when you know
                              the details of the goods or services you plan to buy from a specific
                              supplier in a period, but you do not yet know the detail of your delivery
                              schedules. You can use blanket purchase agreements to specify negotiated
                              prices for your items before actually purchasing them. Prices for
                              items can be negotiated on a blanket purchase agreement by a procurement
                              business unit which can then be made available to multiple requisitioning
                              business units.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Contract Purchase Agreement</p>
                           <p>You create a contract purchase agreement with your supplier
                              to agree on specific terms and conditions without indicating the goods
                              and services that you will be purchasing. You can later issue purchase
                              orders referencing your contracts using terms negotiated on a contract
                              purchase agreement by a procurement business unit which can then be
                              made available to multiple requisitioning business units.
                           </p>

                              your supplier only for services. You can choose a document style that
                              allows only services lines on the agreement.

                              business unit can either perform these functions in response to its
                              own requirements for purchased goods and services or can be set up
                              as a shared procurement service center that can process requisitions
                              from multiple "client" business units.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>As a buyer, you can choose the procurement business
                              unit that will own and manage the supplier agreement through its lifecycle.
                              You can then provide the client business units access to the agreement
                              so they can purchase using the agreement.

                           or a supplier you can initiate a change on a purchasing document by
                           accessing the document from your own work area. You can search for
                           the document, create a change order and start proposing changes. The
                           scope of change that you can propose is determined by the work area
                           that you are using to access the document. For example, if you are
                           accessing the document as a buyer from the purchasing work area then
                           you can propose changes to contract terms and conditions or, if you
                           are accessing the document as a supplier from the supplier work area
                           then you cannot propose changes on purchase order distributions, or
                           if you are accessing an agreement as a catalog administrator from
                           catalog administrator work area then you are allowed to upload lines
                           on an agreement. You can review the details of the changes proposed
                           by selecting the Review Changes action. The Review Changes page shows
                           each and every attribute being changed; it's original and changed
                           values. When you submit a change order for approval, the application
                           validates the change order for accuracy, completeness and policy deviations.

                           relevant for a change order are available in the approval management
                           service, based on which routing rules can be authored, such as PO
                           Ordered Amount Changed, Price Change Percent, or Non Standard Clause
                           Modified. As an internal user, you can view the approvers that the
                           application included on your change order, based on the routing rules,
                           using the Manage Approval page. The page allows you to insert additional
                           approvers and viewers, if required.

                           highlighting critical information needed to make an approval decision

                           with fulfilling the order. Requesters may want to postpone or cancel

                        <p>A purchasing document is a contractually binding document
                           between a buying organization and a selling organization, and hence
                           it captures contractual terms like products or services to be delivered,
                           delivery schedule and payment terms. Any change proposed to any of
                           these kind of attributes must be communicated to and accepted by both
                           parties before the changes become binding. These attributes are called
                           supplier facing attributes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to supplier facing attributes, a purchasing
                           document also contains attributes that are required for administrative
                           purposes within the buying organization, such as cost centers or projects
                           that would be funding the purchase, internal delivery instructions,
                           various tolerances and controls to ensure satisfactory order execution.
                           These attributes are called internal control attributes.

                           control attributes is an internal change order, all other change orders
                           are external. Change order type on a change order indicates whether
                           the change order is an internal change order or an external change
                           order. Unlike an external change order, an internal change order does
                           not get communicated to the supplier and does not cause a new revision
                           of the document. Although internal changes do not cause a new revision
                           of the document, history of such changes is maintained in the same

                           business units. The bill-to BU on the purchase order is derived from
                           the bill-to BU specified on the supplier site assignment for the requisitioning
                           BU on the purchase order.
