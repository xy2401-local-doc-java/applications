                     <p>Oracle Fusion Purchasing provides the following
                        purchase order types: purchase order, blanket purchase agreement,
                        and contract purchase agreement.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Note that your organization can change the
                        names of these documents to suit your business needs, but in their
                        basic form the following describes their function:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Purchase Order</p>
                           <p>You generally create a purchase order for a one-time purchase of
                              various items. You create a purchase order when you know the details
                              of the goods or services that you require, estimated costs, quantities,
                              delivery schedules, and accounting distributions.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Blanket Purchase Agreement</p>
                           <p>You create blanket purchase agreements when you know
                              the details of the goods or services you plan to buy from a specific
                              supplier in a period, but you do not yet know the detail of your delivery
                              schedules. You can use blanket purchase agreements to specify negotiated
                              prices for your items before actually purchasing them. Prices for
                              items can be negotiated on a blanket purchase agreement by a procurement
                              business unit which can then be made available to multiple requisitioning
                              business units.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Contract Purchase Agreement</p>
                           <p>You create a contract purchase agreement with your supplier
                              to agree on specific terms and conditions without indicating the goods
                              and services that you will be purchasing. You can later issue purchase
                              orders referencing your contracts using terms negotiated on a contract
                              purchase agreement by a procurement business unit which can then be
                              made available to multiple requisitioning business units.

                        If it is not, an error or warning is provided.

                        <p>You can validate your document or change order using
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Validate</span> action. If there
                           is an error or warning, the application displays a dialog listing
                           all errors and warnings for you to review. Submitting a document or
                           a change order for approval executes the same validation checks. Some
                           of these validations are performed prior to a change order creating
                           a new version of the document. This ensures that the changes are still
                           relevant in the context of the current state of the document life
                           cycle. For example, any reduction in ordered quantity takes into account
                           any recent receipts and does not reduce the quantity beyond what has
                           already been received.

                           for the requisition. Purchasing terms (prices, terms, conditions,
                           quantity, and so on) must already be negotiated with the supplier.

                           already negotiated with the supplier. You select the option on a requisition
                           line to support automated purchase order creation from the requisition,

                           with the supplier is required to determine the purchasing terms. You
                           should complete the negotiation process before you create the purchase
                           order. From the Process Requisition page, you can create the negotiation
                           document with the requisition line information. Alternatively, you
                           can negotiate purchasing terms offline, and process the requisition
                           line into a purchase order without having a formal negotiation. The
                           application provides a warning that you are bypassing the formal negotiation
                           process, but you can continue.

                              ways they achieve this are; by enabling one legal entity to procure

                              from volume purchases or by channeling purchases for resale via legal

                           <p>In this scenario, business units 1 and 2, US West
                              Coast Distribution and US East Coast Distribution, roll up to legal
                              entity 1, Vision United States. Purchase orders issued by either of
                              these business units to a Chinese supplier site, China Supplier Site1
                              should have the sold-to legal entity set as Vision China. However,
                              the immediate liability for the purchase is not assumed by the requesting
                              organization, rather it is assumed by the Chinese subsidiary. In such
                              cases, the requesting organization typically does not have direct
                              relationship with the supplier site fulfilling the order, instead
                              it is the subsidiary that enters into a contract with the supplier
                              site to buy the ordered goods.

                              order is open. The purchase order becomes a legal document when you

                              To change the supplier after you approve a purchase order, you must
                              cancel the existing purchase order. Then create a new one for the
                              other supplier.

                           <p>The setup to enable automated order buying for items
                              imported through the open interface depends on the procurement strategy
                              of the organization. This falls into two scenarios:
                           </p>

                                    inventory organizations within a requisitioning BU.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The item has a primary supplier across all inventory organizations
                                    within a requisitioning BU being serviced by the procurement BU. For
                                    this scenario it is sufficient to have an agreement in place with
                                    the requisitioning BU added to the list of business units in the <span class="uicontrol">Business Unit Access</span> table of the agreement
                                    and enable the order creation controls on this agreement to automatically
                                    process requisitions sourced to this agreement into purchase orders.
                                 </p>

                                    and pricing information needed to create the purchase order.
                                 </p>

                                    when purchased from an inventory organization. For this scenario,
                                    the following setups need to be performed:
                                 </p>

                                          organization. The <span class="uicontrol">Generate Approved Supplier

                                 <p>When requisitions are created for this item from this
                                    inventory organization, the system will find the local ASL entry for
                                    this item-supplier combination, and then find the agreement listed
                                    on the ASL entry, and determine the supplier, terms and conditions,
                                    and pricing information need to create the purchase order.
                                 </p>

                           <p>For both the above scenarios, in case multiple agreements
                              are found, the system prioritizes agreements in the following order:

                        Management Service (AMX) for purchasing document approvals. Approval
                        Management Service is a robust engine that enables administrators
                        to organize and author approval routing rules based on numerous seeded
                        document attributes such as ordered amount, price, category, and contract
                        terms exist. Based on your unique business requirements, administrators
                        can choose to send the approval request to approvers in parallel or
                        in a sequence. Approvals can be sought using supervisory chain, position
                        or job level hierarchy, or using a list of approvers.

                           based on the requester's supervisory hierarchy. This way, when procuring
                           goods or services, you can enforce different approval policies for
                           different organizations.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can use the name or user name of the top ten
                           supervisors on the requester's supervisory hierarchy. Use this attribute
                           to set up an approval rule condition, where the top-level supervisor's
                           name identifies the organization. To do this, use the Manage Purchasing
                           Document Approvals task. Find the task in the Setup and Maintenance
                           work area, Procurement offering, Approval Management functional area.

                                    be authored in the terms stage.

                           or a supplier you can initiate a change on a purchasing document by

                           the document, create a change order and start proposing changes. The
                           scope of change that you can propose is determined by the work area
                           that you are using to access the document. For example, if you are
                           accessing the document as a buyer from the purchasing work area then
                           you can propose changes to contract terms and conditions or, if you
                           are accessing the document as a supplier from the supplier work area
                           then you cannot propose changes on purchase order distributions, or
                           if you are accessing an agreement as a catalog administrator from
                           catalog administrator work area then you are allowed to upload lines
                           on an agreement. You can review the details of the changes proposed
                           by selecting the Review Changes action. The Review Changes page shows
                           each and every attribute being changed; it's original and changed
                           values. When you submit a change order for approval, the application
                           validates the change order for accuracy, completeness and policy deviations.

                           active purchasing documents. Changes may originate from the requester
                           whose requisition is being processed in the order, or the buyer who's
                           responsible for administering the document or the supplier who's tasked
                           with fulfilling the order. Requesters may want to postpone or cancel

                           on the order. Suppliers may want to stagger delivery schedule or revise
                           pricing. Catalog administrators may want to upload revised catalog

                           change order is consider internal or external depending on the document
                           attributes being changed.

                        <p>A purchasing document is a contractually binding document
                           between a buying organization and a selling organization, and hence
                           it captures contractual terms like products or services to be delivered,
                           delivery schedule and payment terms. Any change proposed to any of
                           these kind of attributes must be communicated to and accepted by both
                           parties before the changes become binding. These attributes are called
                           supplier facing attributes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to supplier facing attributes, a purchasing
                           document also contains attributes that are required for administrative
                           purposes within the buying organization, such as cost centers or projects
                           that would be funding the purchase, internal delivery instructions,
                           various tolerances and controls to ensure satisfactory order execution.
                           These attributes are called internal control attributes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A change order that proposes changes to only internal
                           control attributes is an internal change order, all other change orders
                           are external. Change order type on a change order indicates whether
                           the change order is an internal change order or an external change
                           order. Unlike an external change order, an internal change order does
                           not get communicated to the supplier and does not cause a new revision
                           of the document. Although internal changes do not cause a new revision
                           of the document, history of such changes is maintained in the same
                           manner as external changes and can be accessed from the View Change

                           to replace the first approver. Your organization can also set up an
                           approval rule to route any subsequent requester-initiated change orders
                           to the same override approver. This ensures your override approver
                           is also able to approve any changes you initiate after the requisition
                           is processed into a purchase order.

                           on controls that are defined by your organization. Once all schedules
                           for a given line are closed, the line is closed. When all lines for
                           a given header are closed, the document is closed.

                        <p>A schedule has a status of Closed for Receiving when
                           it satisfies the two receipt close controls. This does not prevent
                           further receipts but begins the steps necessary to automatically close
                           the document. A schedule has a status of Closed for Invoicing when
                           it satisfies the invoice close control. This status will not prevent
                           you from matching an invoice to the purchase order or to the receipt
                           but begins the steps needed to automatically close the document. Both
                           of these statuses can apply to the header, line, and schedule levels.
