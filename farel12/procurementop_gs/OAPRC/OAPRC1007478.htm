                     <p>The Import Requisition process can be used
                        to import requisitions from other Oracle or non-Oracle applications.
                        Requisition information and interface tables are required. During
                        the import process, the requisition levels are validated in succession:
                        header, line, and distribution. Any records that fail validation are
                        reported and not included in further processing. The requisition lines
                        are then grouped into individual requisitions and given unique numbers.
                        It is possible that one record in a requisition header interface table
                        may correspond to multiple requisitions being created because of the
                        grouping of lines. The requisitions that are valid, grouped, and numbered,
                        are inserted into the main requisition tables. Finally, depending
                        on the status of the requisition, the value of the input parameter
                        Initiate Approval after Requisition Import, and the value of the requisitioning

                              For example, if the error threshold is two, loader does not abandon
                              processing of the remaining lines in the upload file when its error
                              count reaches two. Loader will only abandon processing when its error
                              count reaches three which is above the threshold value of two. Also
                              note that if there are some successfully processed lines, loader will
                              pass those lines to PDOI which will attempt to update the agreement with those lines.

                        <p>You cannot selectively approve or reject individual
                           items. You can edit the requisition to add or delete items, modify
                           requisition quantity, and then approve the requisition. If the approver
                           needs to reject specific lines on the requisition, the approver should
                           reject the entire requisition. The approver can include comments on
                           the worklist task to highlight the rejection reason. The preparer
                           then needs to update the requisition and resubmit it for approval.

                     <p>When the requisition life cycle for a requisition

                        if one exists. For example, if all lines on the requisition are placed
                        on one purchase order, all the related downstream documents are visible
                        on one page. If the lines on the requisition are placed on two purchase

                        two groups of requisition lines.

                                       An approved requisition can contain lines with other
                                       statuses such as returned, withdrawn, rejected, and so on. For example,
                                       a requisition with multiple lines is approved, so both the header
                                       and the lines are approved. If a buyer returned a line, the header
                                       and line remains approved with the exception of the returned line
                                       which will have the status of returned. If a line from the approved
                                       requisition is withdrawn, the status remains the same for the other
                                       lines and header, but that line will be withdrawn.
