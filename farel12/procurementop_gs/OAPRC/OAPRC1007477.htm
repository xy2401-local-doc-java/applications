      to select from several approaches based on the company business model. Administrators can define partitions of the local catalog
      using inclusion and exclusion rules for agreements and categories. Administrators or suppliers on behalf of the buying organization
      can upload local catalog content either online or in batch. While batch upload is optimized for large data upload, the online

      in XML, standard text, catalog. interchange format (CIF), or cXML. Through batch upload or online authoring, administrators
      can load new catalogs, update existing catalogs, and delete catalog content. Oracle Fusion Self Service Procurement also supports
      catalogs created in multiple languages and currencies to support requester communities worldwide. Optionally, administrators
      can organize local catalog content in a hierarchical view for users to navigate to the products they want to buy. Administrators
      can setup a punchout to an Oracle Exchange marketplace, such as exchange.oracle.com, or a supplier web store to access their
      catalogs. The punchout catalog can be a direct link to the store, where the requester searches, shops, and returns items to
      Oracle Fusion Self Service Procurement. Administrators can define informational catalogs, which contain instructions or links
      for ordering other items or services at your company. The informational catalog enables Oracle Fusion Self Service Procurement

                        instructions to employees on how to order products. Administrators

                        Like punchout catalogs, informational catalogs can optionally be associated

                     <p>Punchout enables requesters to click on a
                        link that goes to a supplier catalog, search for items on the supplier
                        site, and return those items directly to the requisition. Requesters
                        can then edit and submit the requisition. Using a punchout allows
                        suppliers to maintain and host their own catalog information. This
                        ensures the latest content and pricing is available to requesters.

                           hire kit. The availability of a Public Shopping List is based on the
                           procurement BU in which the list is created, and whether the preparer
                           was granted access to the list. The availability of public shopping
                           lists is driven by the content zone that the list was added to.

                     <h3>Content Zones: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Managing a large number of items and services
                        requires a mechanism for controlling what content should be available
                        to users. The Content Security model provides the ability to control
                        access to catalog content across users. The local catalog provides
                        flexible controls against attributes such as agreements, and categories
                        to determine whether certain items should be included or excluded
                        in the catalog. The content zone will determine which segments of
                        content (local, punchout, informational, and smart forms) should be
                        accessible to what users.

                     <p>The following features are supported through the content
                        security model using content zones:

                           <p>Defining catalogs for local content,
                              punchout, and informational content. Administrators first define the
                              catalogs and then secure the catalogs using content zones. This gives
                              administrators the ability to apply the same catalog definitions to
                              multiple users without having to create multiple content zones.

                              is grouped. In addition, administrators are able to group punchout,
                              informational catalogs, and smart forms by category and the browsing
                              feature also retrieves punchout, informational catalogs, and smart
                              forms together with local content.

                        available to users, catalog administrators need to associate the catalogs,
                        smart forms, and shopping lists to content zones.

                        <p>The catalog administrator is responsible for
                           setting up the content security.  The administrator determines what
                           subset of the content will be accessible to which users in the procurement
                           application.

                           catalog when creating public shopping lists. Buyers access the procurement
                           catalog when creating or updating purchase order, agreement, and requisitions.
                           The content security model restricts what each user can access from
                           the catalog in each flow.

                           can be optionally grouped by commodity. Administrators can define
                           as many levels as they want for their category hierarchy.  Local content
                           is associated to the purchasing categories. Punchout catalogs, informational
                           catalogs, and smart forms can be associated to any level of the hierarchy

                        <p>In this example, the item Fantastic Laptop has two
                           price breaks. The first line in the table contains the item details
                           and the first price break. The second line in the table is another
                           price break for the first line that is the Fantastic Laptop. Note
                           that on the second line the item details fields are all blank. Only
                           the price break fields (Quantity and Break Price) contain data.

                              <p>To prevent multiple occurrence of
                                 the same price break for a line, if you wish to modify a line with
                                 an existing price break, you can do any of the following:
                              </p>

                                 <li>
                                    <p>Remove the price break component
                                       from the upload file before running the upload.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>First, expire the line before reloading
                                       the line with the updated attributes. Note that if this approach is
                                       used on a BPA with an Open status, this effectively creates a new
                                       line in the BPA. If the old BPA line exists on an incomplete requisition,
                                       the line will be sourced again when the requisition is submitted for
                                       approvals. If the requisition was already approved, or is pending
                                       approval, nothing happens to the line.

                                       of the price break elements.

                     <p>A user can then manually log in to the Application
                        in a different language and update the translatable attributes to
                        use the correct language-specific term. For example, a user can log
                        in to the Application in Arabic and enter the Arabic term for Laptop
                        Case for the item description. This is known as a translated record.

                     <p>When a master item is added to a BPA, the item details,
                        for the BPA language are copied over from the item master record to
                        the BPA. For example, if the BPA was created in English, then when
                        a master item is added to the BPA, the English record of the item
                        is copied over to the BPA. Whether the records for the other languages
                        are copied over to the BPA, is dependent on the Profile: Load items
                        in all languages (PO_LOAD_ITEMS_IN_ALL_LANGUAGES). There are four
                        possible values for this profile. Before discussing the values and
                        behavior of the profile options, let's discuss Agreement Loader and
                        translation.

                              <li>
                                 <p>Since CIF and cXML files support
                                    line level languages, a user can upload Description-based items in
                                    the agreement creation language and other languages in the same upload
                                    job. For example, , using a CIF/cXML file, user can create a line
                                    whose line language is the same as the BPA creation language and a
                                    second line with a different line language containing the translated
                                    value for the previous line.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>While loading translations, if the
                                    user changes the values for a non-translatable attribute (in the upload
                                    file), this new value overwrites the existing value in the application.
                                    For example if a Manufacturer URL already exists for a line in English
                                    and while loading a French translation the user specifies a different
                                    Manufacturer URL, this new URL will overwrite the existing Manufacturer
                                    URL for the English version of the line.
                                 </p>
                              </li>
                              
                              <li>
                                 <p>Line uniqueness criteria are used
                                    to determine which line is being translated. As such, the user should
                                    not change the values for any attributes used in line uniqueness identification
                                    during a translation upload. For example, in the absence of an Item
                                    ID, the supplier Item Number is used for line uniqueness identification.
                                    If a line with supplier ID, ABC-01 already exists in English and while
                                    loading a French translation for the same line the user changes the
                                    supplier ID to ABC-02, Loader will not be able to match this to the
                                    existing line with supplier ID ABC-01.
                                 </p>

                     <p>The Agreement Loader is used to upload agreement
                        lines in bulk using a data file. The catalog administrator, the buyer,
                        or the supplier of the agreement can use the Agreement Loader. Loader
                        parses the file based on the file format, performs basic validations
                        on the data provided, and raises errors for failed validations. If
                        no errors are found, the uploaded content is processed and the agreement
                        is updated.

                           threshold, loader stops processing the remaining lines in the upload
                           file. If the error threshold is not reached, loader continues processing
                           the lines till it gets to the end of the file. In both cases, any
                           of the lines processed successfully will be submitted for update against
                           the agreement.

                        <p>The agreement loader parses the input file in an accepted
                           file format, and transfers the validated information to be updated
                           against the agreement. The File formats that are supported by the
                           Agreement Loader are CIF, cXML, TXT and XML.

                           issues, the agreement loader issues error messages. Loader performs
                           some preliminary validations, like checking the validity of catalog
                           attribute names, external mapping translations, data checks and so
                           on. If there are any errors in these validations, an error is raised
                           to the user.

                        of approved agreements. Administrators can define items that should
                        be included or excluded from the local catalog based on blanket agreement
                        and category inclusion and exclusion rules.

                           separated into logical and manageable partitions. These partitions
                           can be created based on purchasing categories, browsing categories,
                           and blanket agreements. Each of the different options that can be
                           used to define a local catalog is referred to as a dimension.

                     <p>There are multiple ways to search for items
                        in the catalog. One way is to browse for items by category.

                        <p>When you enter simple search criteria from the Shop
                           page, the search results appear in a list from which you can sort,
                           compare, add to your shopping list, or add to your requisition.  For
                           example if you search for pens your search will yield a list of pens
                           that are available in the catalog.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Alternatively, you can search for pens using a category
                           search. For example, in the Browse Category region on the Shop Page,
                           you can click on the link for the category Office Supplies. The search
                           results will yield a list of all office supplies in the catalog. You
                           can then drill down the category hierarchy from the top level category
                           Office Supplies selected on the Shop page. For example, the figure
                           below shows if you were shopping for pens, you click on the category
                           Office Supplies and then drill down using the category Pens and Pencils.

                     <p>If you manage a large number of products and
                        services you may need a mechanism to organize the products in the
                        catalog to make it easier for users to navigate to the products they
                        want to buy. The category hierarchy presents a hierarchical view of
                        the catalog to users.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Category hierarchies allow you to create a parent category
                        that includes other categories, which are known as child categories.
                        When users navigate through the parent category, the child categories
                        appear, helping users to navigate quickly to the category which contains
                        the products they need. Categories are used to classify items.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can develop your own method of categorizing products
                        or you can use standard coding systems such as UNSPSC. Some of the
                        benefits of adopting a standard coding system are visibility of spend
                        analysis throughout the corporation, cost control optimization, and
                        ability to explore all the e-commerce capabilities.

                     <p>The figure below shows the category hierarchy for a
                        catalog. There are two types of categories in the catalog that define
                        a catalog hierarchy: Browsing categories and item categories. It is

                        <p>Browsing categories are also known as navigation categories.
                           They define the category hierarchy for category browsing. The category
                           hierarchy helps users browse for catalog items. Browsing categories
                           can be either a parent or child to another category, but cannot contain
                           any items. Browsing categories are optional and companies can decide
                           what categories should be enabled for browsing.

                           and smart forms to the browsing categories. When user navigates to
                           the category, the associated content type will be displayed. An alternative
                           to setting up browsing categories is to tag punchout, informational,
                           and smart forms with keywords, so that users can find them when performing
                           basic search.
