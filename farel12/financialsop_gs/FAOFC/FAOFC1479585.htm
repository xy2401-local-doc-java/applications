                     <p>You can apply all or part of a receipt or
                        on-account credit memo to a single debit item or to several debit
                        items.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, a customer may send a single check to
                        pay all of one invoice and part of another invoice. The customer may
                        also have an on-account credit memo to use with the check to close
                        an open debit item.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>There are these points to consider when applying receipts
                        and on-account credit memos to transactions:

                     <p>During payment processing, Oracle Fusion Receivables
                        matches the remittance reference information on your receipts to open
                        transactions, and presents recommendations for which transactions
                        to use for a given receipt application. This recommendation process
                        operates for manual receipts, lockbox receipts, and receipts uploaded
                        using a spreadsheet.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In general, Receivables generates recommendations
                        rather than applying receipts automatically when there is a data entry
                        error, such as an incorrect invoice number, or when no transaction
                        meets the minimum requirements for automatic receipt application,
                        as defined by your implementation.

                        for Receipt Application Are Calculated</h4>
                        
                        <p>Receivables matches the remittance reference on the
                           receipt to transactions, based on the active Match Receipt By rule.
                           Receivables searches for a Match Receipt By rule to use for comparison
                           in the order customer site, customer account, lockbox (for lockbox
                           processing), and Receivables system options.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you enter an invoice number as the reference
                           number, and the Match Receipt By rule for a customer site is Transaction
                           Number. Receivables looks for and displays the transactions that most
                           closely match the number you enter. If there is an exact match, and
                           if the AutoMatch threshold settings allow, Receivables applies the
                           receipt to the transaction automatically. If there is not an exact
                           match, Receivables displays a list of recommended transactions according
                           to the AutoMatch thresholds.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If AutoApply is enabled, Receivables presents transaction
                           recommendations in the order of their reference score, as calculated
                           by the active AutoMatch rule set, such that the closest matches appear
                           at the top of the list. Each recommendation is accompanied by a reason
                           code explaining why the receipt wasn't applied to the transaction
                           automatically. For example, if a recommendation has the reason <span class="uicontrol">Below transaction threshold</span>, this indicates
                           that the receipt wasn't automatically applied because the transaction
                           reference score didn't meet the minimum threshold required for automatic
                           application.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you submit a lockbox, Receivables can in many
                           cases match receipts to transactions and apply the receipts automatically.
                           In cases where receipts are not applied automatically, Receivables
                           generates a list of recommended transactions for you to complete the
                           receipt application process manually.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you manually create a standard receipt, use the <span class="uicontrol">Submit and AutoApply Now</span> button to automatically
                           apply the receipt. Receivables displays either the applications it
                           has made or any recommendations for receipt application. For proposed
                           recommendations, you can then select the transactions that you want
                           and manually apply the receipt.

                        <p>After the receipt is applied to the transaction, Receivables
                           updates the receipt and transaction amounts, and displays any over
                           or under payments for processing according to the details of the application

                     <p>You can apply an open receipt against another
                        open receipt.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You apply a receipt against another open receipt
                        in order to move funds between receipts. Open receipts include receipts
                        that have either unapplied cash or on-account cash. You can then apply
                        the resulting unapplied receipt balance to a transaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To use receipt-to-receipt applications, you must set
                        up a clearing account under the Receivables activity Payment Netting
                        to manage the offset of the one receipt against the other.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Both receipts in a receipt-to-receipt application
                        must be in the same currency. If both receipts are in a foreign currency,
                        the result of the receipt application may be an exchange gain or loss.
                        The exchange gain or loss is realized on the target receipt at the
                        time of receipt application. If you later adjust the conversion rate
                        on either receipt, the accounting is rederived using the adjusted
                        conversion rate.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can unapply a receipt that was applied to another
                        open receipt, provided that neither receipt is drawn negative by unapplying
                        it.

                     <p>A write-off is a receipt activity that cancels
                        an open debit item and assigns it to a write-off account. You can
                        write off both overpayment and underpayment amounts.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You write off an overpayment when, after applying
                        a receipt to debit items, a small unapplied amount remains. You write
                        off an underpayment when a receipt underpays an invoice by a small
                        amount and the write-off is preferable to billing the customer for
                        the difference.

                     <p>Use cross-currency receipt applications to
                        process payments that customers make in a currency that is different
                        from the currency of the open debit item. You can apply cross-currency
                        receipts to invoices, debit memos, and chargebacks.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When you apply a cross-currency receipt, Oracle Fusion
                        Receivables calculates both the open balance on the transaction (if
                        any) and the foreign exchange gain or loss for the application.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can apply receipts to transactions using any currency
                        defined in Oracle Fusion General Ledger.

                           determine the Cross-Currency Rate of 0.7111111 (64/90). Receivables
                           then determines the Allocated Receipt Amount Base (in your ledger
                           currency) of 56.64 USD, using the conversion rate as of the receipt
                           date. Finally, Receivables calculates an Exchange Loss of 3.36 USD.

                           You can reapply both automatic and manually entered receipts before

                        <p>Unapplying a receipt reopens each transaction or transaction
                           line that was previously closed by the receipt. Oracle Fusion Receivables
                           enters a reversal accounting date for each transaction or transaction
                           line reopened. The reversal accounting date, which is the date to
                           post this reapplication to general ledger, is the same as either the
                           accounting date of the original application or, if the original application
                           accounting date is in a closed period, the system date. If the system
                           date is not in an open period, the default is the last date of the

                           for your customers when closing an existing debit item. You can also
                           create a chargeback against a credit memo or on-account credit with
                           a positive balance.

                           to the transaction and to the chargeback allow overapplication, you
                           can enter a chargeback amount greater than the original balance due.

                                 receipt is approved. If authorization is not successful, then the
                                 receipt is rejected from the batch.

                     <p>When you create an automatic receipt batch, the process
                        applies receipts to customer transactions and transfers funds from
                        the customer bank account or credit card to your bank account on the
                        receipt maturity date.

                        <p>You wouldn't normally use discounts with automatic
                           receipts, because the concept of early payment doesn't apply. You
                           and the customer decide the receipt maturity date in advance, and
                           the automatic receipt process transfers funds from the customer bank
                           account or credit card on that date only.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>You can calculate earned discounts on payments for
                           automatic receipts that don't require confirmation, if you set up
                           payment terms with the transaction due date equal to the discount
                           date. For example, if the payment terms specify that a transaction
                           is due 30 days after the transaction date, create a percentage discount
                           for 30 days after the transaction date. This identifies the 30-day
                           period as a discount period.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can't use discounts with automatic receipts that
                           require confirmation by the customer. Alternatively, you can define
                           an Earned Discount receivables activity and create an adjustment to
                           reduce the balance on transactions by the discount amount. You then
                           charge the adjusted amount to this receivables activity discount account.

                        <p>Many of the setup objects used in automatic
                           receipt processing have start and end date ranges, such as receipt
                           methods, remittance bank accounts, and customer bank accounts. Date
                           ranges determine which objects display in lists of values.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You must ensure that the setup objects used in automatic
                           receipts do not contain inconsistent or overlapping date ranges.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, if you assign a receipt method with a
                           date range of 01-SEP-10 to 30-SEP-10 to one of your customers, you

                        <p>The automatic receipt process assigns one
                           of your remittance bank accounts to each receipt created by the payment

                           method and currency of the transaction. The one exception to this
                           is if a non-primary remittance bank account belonging to the same
                           receipt method uses the same currency as the customer bank account.
                           In this case, the automatic receipt process uses this remittance bank
                           account instead.

                           a customer bank account in the same currency helps you both to avoid
                           bank charges and to expedite funds transfer.

                        that the batch contains all of the receipts that you want. You can
                        approve an automatic receipt batch that has a status of Creation Completed
                        or Started Approval.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can update the automatic receipt batch before
                        you approve it, as long as there are no concurrent processes for creating
                        or approving this batch that are either running or pending.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can remove transactions from the batch. Transactions
                        that you remove are available for selection the next time you submit
                        the automatic receipt creation program. If applicable, you can also
                        update conversion rate information.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can delete an automatic receipt batch that has
                        the status Creation Completed without approving it. When you delete
                        a batch, all of the transactions in the batch become available for
                        selection the next time you submit the automatic receipt creation
                        program.

                     <p>You can update the bank name, bank branch, and customer
                        bank account associated with each of the transactions in the batch.
                        Updates to bank information are limited to selecting a new customer
                        bank or bank account for a transaction that is assigned to either
                        this customer or the primary customers of this customer. In addition,
                        this bank must have a bank account in the same currency as the automatic
                        receipt batch.

                        automatic receipts that don't require confirmation according to the <span class="uicontrol">Number of Receipts Rule</span> on the receipt method
                        and closes the transactions they are paying.

                        bank account. Receivables uses the <span class="uicontrol">Receipt

                     <p>Depending on the agreement you have with your customer,
                        certain types of automatic receipts require confirmation from your
                        customer before they can be considered payments and remitted to the
                        bank. Once your customer approves these receipts, you can make any
                        necessary changes, then confirm the receipts.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When a customer confirms the automatic receipt batch,
                        they may provide a confirmation number for each receipt. Enter this
                        number in the available reference or comment field. This number is
                        passed to your remittance bank, which can then forward it to the customer
                        bank. This helps your customers to reconcile their accounts.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the receipt class of the receipt method assigned
                        to an automatic receipt or automatic receipt batch requires confirmation,
                        you must confirm the receipt or receipt batch once it has been approved
                        by your customer. Receipts that require confirmation automatically
                        close the invoices for which they were created when you confirm them.
                        After confirming the automatic receipt batch, you can create a remittance
                        batch to initiate the transfer of funds for each receipt.

                           you can manually enter this as a standard receipt. You must select
                           a receipt method assigned to a receipt class that has a creation method
                           of Automatic.

                           the funds are transferred from the customer bank account to your bank
                           account.

                        <p>A debit memo reversal is different from a
                           standard reversal because, instead of reopening the debit and credit
                           items that were closed with the original receipt, Receivables creates
                           one new receivable in the amount of the net of the closed debit and
                           credit transactions. As a result, the reversed receipt shows the transaction
                           as still applied.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You must create a debit memo reversal under each of
                           these circumstances:
                        </p>

                                 which you have created a chargeback, and this chargeback has had activity
                                 against it, such as another receipt, a credit memo, or an adjustment.

                                 would draw the balance of Receipt B negative.

                        <p>To create a debit memo reversal, you enter
                           a debit memo transaction type. The debit memo transaction type provides
                           the default receivable account distribution for the new debit item.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>If the receipt that you are reversing uses a receipt
                           method with the <span class="uicontrol">Debit Memos Inherit Receipt
                              Number</span> option enabled, you can control whether the debit
                           memo has the same transaction number as the original receipt. If the <span class="uicontrol">Debit Memos Inherit Receipt Number</span> option
                           is not enabled, Receivables uses the predefined Debit Memo Reversal
                           transaction source to determine the numbering for the debit memo reversal.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you are using manual document numbering, enter
                           a unique document number for this reversal. If you are using automatic
                           numbering, Receivables assigns a unique document number to the new
                           debit memo.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you create a debit memo reversal, Receivables
                           generates the line item from the predefined memo line. Receivables
                           creates this line on the debit memo:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>Debit memo for reversal of payment {PAYMENT_NUMBER}<br></code></pre>
                        <p>where <code>{PAYMENT_NUMBER}</code> represents the original receipt number.
                        </p>

                        <p>When you create a debit memo reversal, Receivables
                           creates the accounting entries on the new debit memo transaction rather
                           than on the original receipt. This ensures that you do not make duplicate
                           entries, and eliminates the need for a clearing account.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>With regular debit memos, AutoAccounting creates both
                           the receivable and revenue account distributions. With debit memo
                           reversals, the debit memo transaction type provides the receivable
                           account distribution, and the cash account on the receipt is used
                           as the revenue account distribution.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The cash account used depends on the status of the
                           receipt at the time of the creation of the debit memo reversal. For
                           example, if the receipt was remitted, then the cash account is the
                           same as the remitted account assigned to the receipt method of the
                           receipt.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you create a debit memo reversal, Receivables
                           creates these two entries:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ol>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>The first entry decreases the cash
                                 account.
                              </p>
                              <p>Receivables already recognized revenue
                                 on the original transaction. To avoid overstating the cash and revenue
                                 accounts, Receivables does not create an additional entry to revenue.
                                 Instead, Receivables assigns the cash account to the revenue line
                                 on the debit memo.
                              </p>
                              
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>The second entry creates the new
                                 receivable.
                              </p>
                              <p>When the original receipt was applied,
                                 Receivables closed the transactions and their associated receivables.
                                 You must therefore establish a new receivable to track the new debit
                                 item.

                           to the customer, either with a refund or an on-account credit, you
                           must create a credit memo against the original transaction that was

                           entered in the bank transmission file is 2582.87, but lockbox calculates

                                 each record and the total amount and number of receipts in each lockbox
                                 transmission.

                        <p>The Import section of the report is generated when
                           you submit the lockbox import step. The report prints a line at the
                           end of the Import section informing you of any rejected or discarded
                           files.

                           always creates a .log file which can be found in the $AR_TOP/out directory.
                           The .log file contains general information about the activity of your
                           SQL*Loader run, including the reason that the record was not imported.

                           same directory, if it has records to write to these files. The .bad
                           file contains information about any records that were rejected due
                           to formatting or Oracle errors, such as an invalid date. The .dis
                           file contains discarded records that did not satisfy any of the WHEN
                           clauses in your control file.

                           if you set the <span class="uicontrol">Submit Validation</span> parameter to Yes. Use this section of the report to see the number

                           lockbox submission. The paying customer should be identified by a
                           customer or MICR number on the receipt record. Otherwise, if you are
                           using AutoMatch when applying a receipt from Customer A to a transaction
                           from Customer B, the receipt is designated as paid by Customer B.
                           Additionally, all transactions listed to be paid by one receipt must
                           belong to the same customer, otherwise lockbox imports the receipts
                           as Unapplied.

                           to which transaction to apply the payment. The receipt is left in
                           one of these statuses:

                                 Method: On the original credit card transactions, use a receipt class
                                 with a remittance method of Standard. When you refund these payments,
                                 the credit card refund (negative miscellaneous receipt) inherits the
                                 remittance method from the original receipt.

                        <p>The Create Automatic Remittances program passes the
                           negative miscellaneous receipt information to Payments. The Create

                        <p>Payments initiates a refund even if the credit card
                           has expired, because expired credit cards are usually reissued with
                           a new expiration date. If a credit card has expired and was not reissued,
                           then the credit card issuer declines the transaction and Payments
                           reverses the refund.

                           application either before or after the negative miscellaneous receipt

                           lines on the receipt and reverses the associated negative miscellaneous
                           receipt.

                           the credit card refund application because Receivables assumes that
                           the receipt was already refunded. In this case, when you reverse the
                           original receipt, you must create a debit memo reversal.
                        </p>

                           receipt) and the payment in order to reconcile with your bank. Reversing
                           a negative miscellaneous receipt automatically unapplies the refund
                           from the original receipt. You can then reverse the original receipt,

                        <p>A standard remittance refers to the common
                           practice of remitting receipts. You remit automatic receipts to your
                           bank so that the bank can transfer funds from customer bank accounts
                           to your bank account on the receipt maturity date. You remit manual
                           receipts so that the bank credits your bank account when the customer
                           check clears.

                        <p>The remittance process initiates the transfer of payment
                           for transactions that are paid by credit card or Electronic Funds
                           Transfer (EFT) for both direct debit and Automated Clearing House
                           (ACH) bank account transfer.

                        <p>A factored remittance is a sale of accounts
                           receivable to your bank in exchange for cash. You remit receipts to
                           your bank so that the bank can lend you money against the receipts
                           either before the maturity date for automatic receipts or before clearing
                           for manual receipts.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>To factor receipts, you must identify the remittance
                           method of the remittance batch as Factored. In addition, you can only
                           factor receipts assigned a receipt class with a remittance method
                           of <span class="uicontrol">Factoring</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Standard and Factoring</span>.

                        <p>After clearing factored receipts, Receivables creates
                           a short term debt for the borrowed amount to track your liability
                           in case of customer default.

                        <p>You can track your risk of customer default when you
                           factor a receipt with your bank. In this case, Receivables creates
                           a short term debt for the risk when the receipt is cleared. Run the
                           Clear Receipts Automatically program to eliminate your risk on or
                           after the maturity date of your automatic receipts.

                           provided the bank account allows multiple currencies. If you are remitting
                           receipts in foreign currencies, set the <span class="uicontrol">Conversion

                           the log file for your largest automatic remittance creation batch.

                     <p>Best practice for clearing receipts from banks
                        is to use Oracle Fusion Cash Management. Clearing through Cash Management
                        automatically generates reconciliation accounting entries that are
                        posted to the general ledger.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can also use the Clear Receipts Automatically
                        program in Oracle Fusion Receivables to automatically clear remitted
                        receipts, and clear or eliminate risk on factored receipts.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The Clear Receipts Automatically program manages the
                        clearing process for both remitted and factored receipts. The receipts
                        that you intend to clear with the Clear Receipts Automatically program
                        must belong to a receipt class with a clearance method of Automatic.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you don't want to recognize the cash until it is
                        deposited into your bank account, you can reconcile the bank statement
                        within your accounts receivable. This step is optional for both automatic
                        and manual receipts.
                     </p>

                           defined for the receipt method/bank account combination assigned to
                           the receipt.

                           to review receipts awaiting remittance to your bank. You can either
                           review all receipts or receipts that are in a certain stage of the
                           remittance process. By default the report includes receipts that have
                           started but not yet completed the creation or approval process.

                           that require remittance. Automatic receipts can only appear on the
                           report if they do not require confirmation or if they require confirmation
                           and are confirmed.

                        <p>Once a receipt is approved for remittance it will
                           no longer appear on the report.
