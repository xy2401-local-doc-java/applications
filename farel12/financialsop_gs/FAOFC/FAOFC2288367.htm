                        Management</h4>
                        
                        
                        <p>In Oracle Fusion Revenue Management, customer
                           contracts are made up of a series of source lines. These sources lines
                           represent different portions of the contract.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, if a customer signs a contract to supply
                           computer hardware and also to provide technical support for one year
                           from the date of installation, then the portion of the contract related
                           to the supply of computer hardware is captured as a sales order and
                           the portion of the contract related to technical support is captured
                           as a service contract.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The individual documents are extracted from these
                           applications at different points of time and are interfaced with Revenue
                           Management as source documents. In Revenue Management, these documents
                           are identified as belonging to one customer contract. The Customer
                           Contract document is created with lines of these documents.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>To combine multiple source document lines into a
                           single customer contract automatically, there must be a common link
                           between these documents. This common link can be:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>An identifier that is captured
                                 on all the source documents or source document lines, for example,
                                 a customer's purchase order number.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>A specific time period. In other
                                 words, all source document lines were created for a customer within
                                 a short span of time.
                              </p>
                              <p>For example, multiple source
                                 document lines created for the same customer within 30 days should
                                 form part of one accounting contract for revenue recognition purposes.

                                 were purchased independently and the invoice must be split into ten

                                 are related, and the invoice must be split into multiple contracts
                                 with related items added to one contract.
                              </p>

                                 case, the invoice will result in more than one, but fewer than eleven
                                 customer contracts.
                              </p>

                           over a period of time.  A customer contract can be represented in
                           the upstream applications as source documents in many ways:

                     <p>A performance obligation is a distinct promise
                        in the customer contract to transfer goods or services to the customer.
                        A customer contract can have one or more performance obligations.
                        The source document lines that are included in a contract are grouped
                        into performance obligations.

                     <p>Your company has just launched
                        a new hardware product in August 2016. The product is targeted at
                        only large and medium enterprise customers in the US market. The product
                        has never been available to the general public before and therefore,
                        there are no standalone selling prices. No other competitors sell
                        similar or comparable products. The revenue manager has worked with
                        the sales director who owns this product and the internal compliance
                        team and obtained an approved selling price list on August 14, 2016.
