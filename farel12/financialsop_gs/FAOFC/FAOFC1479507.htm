                     <p>Before you can complete a transaction in Oracle
                        Fusion Receivables, you must ensure that you have entered all required
                        information. The information required to complete a transaction differs
                        depending on the transaction class.

                     <p>When you complete a transaction, Receivables creates
                        payment schedules based on the payment terms and invoice date that
                        you specified. If the transaction type on the transaction has <span class="uicontrol">Open Receivables</span> set to Yes, Receivables includes
                        the transaction in the standard aging and collection process. If you
                        later change the transaction type to one with <span class="uicontrol">Open Receivables</span> set to No, Receivables removes this
                        transaction from the standard aging and collection process.

                     <h3>Invoice Distributions: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Invoice distributions are the default revenue
                        account assignments for each line of the invoice. Oracle Fusion Receivables
                        uses AutoAccounting to derive the default revenue accounts for the
                        invoice after invoice entry. You can review or update the distributions
                        for an invoice in the Edit Distributions window.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The default accounting that AutoAccounting creates
                        is considered interim accounting only. Use the Create Receivables
                        Accounting program to actually create accounting entries in subledger
                        accounting. Receivables uses predefined setup in subledger accounting
                        so that the Create Receivables Accounting program accepts the default
                        accounts that AutoAccounting derives without change.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you are reviewing distributions for an invoice that
                        uses a revenue scheduling rule, you must run Revenue Recognition before
                        you can review and update accounting distributions. The revenue scheduling
                        rule recognizes revenue over multiple general ledger periods.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the invoice is a project-related invoice, then
                        no distribution information is displayed.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>One or more rows can refer to the same transaction
                        line, depending on the distributions. You can change the transaction
                        account assigned to each distribution, but you can't create new lines
                        or delete existing lines. If you change a row that has already posted
                        to general ledger, Receivables doesn't alter the posted entry, but
                        instead creates adjustments through additional accounting entries.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The default percent amount of each invoice line assigned
                        to a transaction account is 100 percent, unless AutoAccounting is
                        based on salesperson and the salesperson assignment is split. In this
                        case, the field reflects the split and you can either accept this
                        percentage or enter another one.

                     <p>Use revenue scheduling rules to determine revenue
                        recognition schedules for your invoice lines. Revenue scheduling rules
                        determine the accounting period or periods in which to record revenue
                        distributions. You can assign a different revenue scheduling rule
                        to each invoice line.

                        <p>Rules of this type also require both a start and end
                           date to enable the calculation of the daily revenue rate.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The Fixed Schedule rule type requires both a period
                           type (such as weekly or monthly) and the number of periods over which
                           to recognize revenue. The revenue is then evenly divided across the
                           periods.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can update the percentage of revenue recognized
                           in each period, but the percentage for the entire schedule must always
                           total 100. For example, if you define a revenue scheduling rule with
                           a period type of monthly that spans four periods, and you accept the
                           prorated revenue distribution, Receivables recognizes 25 percent of
                           the transaction revenue in each of the four months.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you select a period type of Specific Date for a
                           fixed schedule rule, you can set specific accounting dates on which
                           to recognize revenue. When you specify a date for one period, then
                           all other periods also require a specific accounting date.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The Variable Schedule rule type also requires a period
                           type, but not the number of periods. The number of periods is calculated
                           automatically either when you enter a transaction manually or import
                           using AutoInvoice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When you define a variable schedule revenue scheduling
                           rule, you can optionally specify what percentage of revenue you want
                           to recognize in the first period. The remaining revenue is then prorated
                           over the number of periods that you specify when the transaction is
                           created.
                        </p>

                              in each period. Receivables uses the final period to catch up with

                              first period. Receivables evenly distributes the revenue balance over
                              the remaining periods. In this example, 20 percent of the total revenue
                              is recognized in the first period out of a total of four periods.

                           a given sequence. If you are using manual or partial automatic numbering,
                           the report only validates that the numbers are unique, not that they
                           are sequential.

                           always used in all legal entities assigned to the ledger:

                           still possible to have missing document numbers. For example, a rollback
                           of your database can cause missing document numbers. When you roll
                           back a transaction after a document number was assigned, the document
                           number is removed. When you resume entering data for the transaction,
                           a new sequence number is assigned.

                           report includes all transactions that increase or decrease the customer
                           outstanding balance for the specified period.

                           customer balances but do not post to the general ledger by setting
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Post to General Ledger Eligible</span> parameter to No. Use this parameter option for your transactions
                           that are imported into Receivables from non-Oracle billing systems
                           that post directly to the general ledger. When you import these transactions
                           into Receivables, the <span class="uicontrol">Post to GL</span> option on the transaction types assigned to these transactions is
                           not enabled, because they are already accounted in the general ledger.
                           Receivables is then used to track these transactions for payment and
                           collection purposes.

                           needed.

                           due in 60 days.

                     <p>Use Recurring Billing to manage the creation
                        of invoices on a cyclical basis for a fixed period of time, as reflected
                        in the terms of a contract with your customer. Examples include the
                        use of rental equipment at a fixed monthly rate, or consulting services
                        provided on an ongoing basis for the life of a project.

                     <p>Use the Create Recurring Bill Plan page to define
                        a bill plan according to the negotiated terms of the contract with
                        your customer. Important components of the bill plan include contract
                        and billing dates, billing frequency, payment terms, receipt method
                        and payment instrument details, and the items or memo lines to be
                        billed.

                     <p>Generate invoices for a bill plan by running the
                        Generate Recurring Billing Data program. This program loads invoice
                        lines into the AutoInvoice interface tables. You then run Import AutoInvoice
                        to group invoice lines into invoices per bill plan and bill plan period,
                        and import the invoices into Receivables.

                        for and review your bill plans and to create a duplicate bill plan.
                        Use the Edit Recurring Bill Plan page to update an individual bill
                        plan to reflect changes to the terms of a contract.

                        pages to search for and review the transactions created by a bill
                        plan. Use the Review Installments window to review and update unpaid
                        installments on an invoice generated by a bill plan, according to
                        the changes requested by your customer.

                     <p>If you need to update any dates related to the bill

                     <p>If necessary, you can inactivate a bill plan, and

                        the next run of the Generate Recurring Billing Data program creates
                        transactions for all applicable billing periods, including the periods
                        during which the bill plan was inactive.

                        lines to include on each invoice. After you create a recurring bill
                        plan, you use AutoInvoice to generate invoices for a given billing
                        period according to the bill plan definition.

                                             the end of the contract and therefore the bill plan. You can't generate
                                             invoices after the contract end date.

                     <h3>Updating Recurring Bill Plans: Points to Consider</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You may need to update one or more details
                        of a recurring bill plan to reflect changes to the terms of the contract
                        with your customer.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Use the Edit Recurring Bill plan page to update a
                        bill plan. Until you generate transactions for a bill plan, you can
                        update any attribute except the business unit assignment and the bill
                        plan name. Updates to a bill plan that has not generated transactions
                        are not tracked in the recurring bill plan history.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Once you generate transactions for a bill plan, the
                        attributes that you can update are restricted, and all changes are
                        tracked in the recurring bill plan history, except for updates to
                        special instructions or descriptive flexfields.
                     </p>

                        Updates to a recurring bill plan affect future-generated
                        transactions only. You can't use the bill plan to modify transactions
                        already generated by the bill plan.

                           upon a new end date for the contract. While the bill plan is inactive:

                           1 with a billing frequency of Monthly. The first invoice was generated
                           on January 1, but the bill plan was inactivated on January 20. After
                           negotiations, the bill plan was reactivated on March 15. The next
                           run of the Generate Recurring Billing Data program generates invoices
                           for February and March.

                     <p>You run the Generate Recurring Billing Data program
                        to generate invoice lines. You then run the Import AutoInvoice program
                        to create invoices from invoice lines. If necessary, you can use the
                        AutoInvoice workbook to correct errors and reload your data.

                           generate invoice lines for active bill plans. By default, the program
                           generates invoice lines for all eligible bill plans belonging to all
                           business units. You can use the program parameters to select a subset
                           of bill plans by business unit, bill plan name, billing frequency,
                           and customer.

                           for active bill plans using the parameters you selected and identifies
                           the bill plans eligible for invoicing. A bill plan is eligible for
                           invoicing if the first transaction date (or second transaction date,
                           if used) is on or after the system date and within the billing period.

                        with Oracle Fusion Receivables. The validation process ensures that
                        the columns in the AutoInvoice Interface tables reference the appropriate
                        values and columns in Receivables.

                           line-level data in the interface tables, and validates additional
                           data that is not dependent upon a successful grouping. Additional
                           data validations include, for example, validating transaction types
                           and validating that only one freight account exists for each freight
                           line passed.

                        <p>AutoInvoice ensures that there is at most one freight
                           line for an imported invoice, or at most one freight line per transaction
                           line, but not both. If you import multiple header freight lines for
                           one invoice, AutoInvoice validates that all of the freight lines apply
                           to the same freight account and consolidates them into one line. This
                           consolidated freight line is the only freight line for this invoice
                           that is passed to the Receivables tables. If all of the freight lines
                           don't apply to the same freight account, then AutoInvoice rejects
                           the invoice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If AutoAccounting for Freight is based on Standard
                           Lines, then you can't import invoices with header level freight. All
                           freight lines in this case must be associated with a standard line
                           in order for AutoAccounting to determine the account. If the transaction
                           has a line type of LINE with an inventory item of freight (FRT), AutoAccounting
                           uses the revenue scheduling rules for the freight account rather than
                           the revenue account.

                           lines. If LINE_TYPE = CHARGES, AutoInvoice doesn't calculate tax,
                           freight, or sales credits on this line. If you pass a late charges
                           distribution in RA_INTERFACE_DISTRIBUTIONS_ALL, then the ACCOUNT_CLASS

                     <p>The values that you can pass to AutoInvoice for the
                        accounting flexfield are either accounting segment values or account
                        code combination IDs. Use the <span class="uicontrol">Accounting Flexfield</span> option in the Accounting section of the Import Information section
                        of the transaction source assigned to transactions to set the value
                        that you plan to use.

                           freight (FRT), AutoAccounting uses the rules for the freight type

                     <p>Transaction flexfields are descriptive flexfields
                        that AutoInvoice uses to identify transactions and transaction lines.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>There are four types of transaction flexfields:</p>
                     
                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Line Transaction Flexfield</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Reference Transaction Flexfield</p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Link-To Transaction Flexfield</p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Invoice Transaction Flexfield</p>
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>If you use AutoInvoice, you must define the Line Transaction
                        Flexfield. Because the Line Transaction Flexfield is unique for each
                        transaction line, you use the Line Transaction Flexfield to reference
                        and link to other lines. AutoInvoice always uses the Line Transaction
                        Flexfield structure for both Link-to and Reference information during
                        the import process. You must explicitly define the Link-to, Reference,
                        and Invoice Transaction Flexfield structures only if this information
                        is to be displayed on a custom page.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can display Invoice Transaction Flexfield information
                        in the Reference column of invoice lists of values. Use the <span class="uicontrol">Reference Field Default Value</span> field of the
                        Imported transaction source that you will use with the Import AutoInvoice
                        program to select the Invoice Transaction Flexfield segment that you
                        want to display. For example, if you want to reference the order number
                        for imported invoices when using an invoice list of values, you must
                        assign the transaction flexfield segment that holds the order number
                        in the <span class="uicontrol">Reference Field Default Value</span> field of the transaction source assigned to invoices. The order
                        number then displays in the Reference column of invoice lists of values.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If necessary, you can set the transaction flexfield
                        and flexfield segments as required:

                           a new flexfield with a similar structure as the Line Transaction Flexfield,
                           but only include header level segments.

                           only. You should also include segments included in the Invoice Transaction

                           set up your indexes.

                        bill format for these invoices.

                        receipt methods, payment details, purchase order numbers, and invoicing
                        rules.

                        the Create Balance Forward Bill program selects transactions for inclusion
                        on a balance forward bill.

                        <p>You must select a billing cycle and a currency for
                           a balance forward bill.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the billing cycle of the balance forward bill is
                           External (derived from imported transactions), then you must enter
                           a billing date. The program includes on the bill only those transactions
                           with a billing date on or before the date you enter.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you change the billing cycle for a customer or
                           group of customers, transactions entered after the change inherit
                           the payment terms attached to the new billing cycle, but existing
                           transactions retain the old payment terms. During the next submission
                           of the Create Balance Forward Bill program, existing transactions
                           with no activity against them inherit the new payment terms, billing
                           date, and due date. Transactions with activity retain their existing
                           payment terms, billing date, and due date.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the balance forward bill contains transactions
                           that retain the old payment terms, this may cause an aging discrepancy.
                           This is because the transactions that don't inherit the new payment
                           terms may have due dates different from the other transactions on
                           the bill. If necessary, you can run the program for one set of payment
                           terms only within the selected billing cycle.

                     <p>When you credit a transaction and create a
                        credit memo, this assigns a revenue and tax account to each credit
                        memo line and generates the default distribution amount for each account
                        assignment. Use the Distributions window to review and update the
                        account assignments for credit memo and tax lines.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the transaction you are crediting has associated
                        freight charges, you can also update credit memo freight distributions,
                        unless the credit memo transaction type has <span class="uicontrol">Allow Freight</span> set to No or you have specified a standard
                        memo line of type Tax.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can directly update account assignments that haven't
                        posted. If you update an account assignment that has already posted,
                        Receivables doesn't change the original assignment but creates instead
                        two new account assignments. The first assignment offsets the original
                        posted account assignment and the second assignment records the new
                        amount or account that you have updated.

                           a partial credit amount or percentage on line, tax, or freight. The

                           the balance due for each line that you credit and creates all of the
                           accounting reversal entries. Receivables also reverses this percentage
                           of the sales revenue and non-revenue credits assigned to salespersons.

                           line-level updates. If you again update line, tax, or freight in the <span class="uicontrol">Transaction Amounts</span> section, you must let

                           If you base your accounting distributions on sales credits, the sales

                           to this salesperson. If the sales credits are derived based on a percentage

                           distribution for invoice, debit memo, and credit memo transactions.
                           Each distribution is stored as a unique record, based on the primary
                           key cust_trx_line_gl_dist_id. The customer_trx_line_id column is a
                           foreign key to the RA_CUSTOMER_TRX_LINES table.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The account_class column describes the account type,
                           while the code_combination_id column identifies the general ledger
                           account. Valid account classes are CHARGES, FREIGHT, REC, REV, SUSPENSE,
                           TAX, UNBILL, and UNEARN. The account_class REC represents the receivable
                           account distribution. The amount column for REC records is equal to
                           the sum of all invoice lines. Therefore, there is no link to the RA_CUSTOMER_TRX_LINES
                           table and the column customer_trx_line_id is null for these records.
                           The REC record is linked to the RA_CUSTOMER_TRX table via the customer_trx_id
                           column. For all other account classes, credits are represented by
                           positive numbers and debits are represented by negative numbers.

                     <p>An intercompany transaction is a transaction
                        between two entities with common ownership. The accounting for intercompany
                        transactions is recorded separate from standard transactions in Oracle
                        Fusion Receivables.

                     <p>Receivables determines a transaction to be an intercompany
                        transaction based on the first party (legal entity) and third party
                        (bill-to customer) relationship defined in the intercompany accounting
                        setup. When a transaction is marked as intercompany, the intercompany
                        receivables account is used for accounting instead of the standard
                        receivables account derived from AutoAccounting. This applies to transactions
                        both created manually and imported using AutoInvoice.

                           The intercompany account derivation occurs after the transaction is
                           created but before the intercompany transaction is complete.

                                 adjustments are not marked as intercompany and do not derive an intercompany

                        <p>You can review estimated tax amounts on draft Projects
                           invoices before transfer to Receivables. You can review estimated
                           tax amounts for the entire invoice or for selected invoice lines.
                           You can also print invoices in Projects with estimated tax amounts.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Projects invoices use the same tax configuration,
                           as defined in Oracle Fusion Tax, as that used by Receivables. However,
                           final tax calculation on Projects invoices only takes place after
                           transfer to Receivables. If there are any changes in the tax configuration
                           between invoice creation in Projects and invoice transfer to Receivables,
                           the final tax calculation may differ from the estimated calculation
                           on the draft invoice.
