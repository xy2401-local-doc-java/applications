                     <h3>Applying Transactions to Bills Receivable: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can apply any class of transaction to
                        a bill receivable. You can also apply a bill receivable that has the
                        status Unpaid to a new bill receivable.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>By default, you can only apply transactions that
                        belong to the drawee and its related customers. If the Receivables
                        system option <span class="uicontrol">Allow payment of unrelated
                           transactions</span> is enabled, then you can apply transactions
                        of unrelated customers to the bill.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can apply full or partial transaction amounts
                        to a bill. To apply a partial amount, update the <span class="uicontrol">Applied Amount</span> field with the amount that you want. The
                        unapplied portion of a transaction remains an open item.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you designated an amount for the bill receivable,
                        you must apply transactions to equal the designated amount. You can't
                        complete a bill receivable with a designated amount until the total
                        transaction application amounts equal this amount.
                     </p>

                        Transactions applied to a bill receivable follow
                        the natural application rule, even though the individual transactions
                        assigned to the bill may allow for overapplication.

                     <p>You can only apply transactions that have the same
                        currency as the bill receivable, and all transactions applied to the
                        bill must share the same conversion rate. The bill inherits the conversion
                        rate from the transactions assigned to it when you complete the bill.
                        If you want to apply transactions with a different currency, you must
                        remove all transactions currently applied to the bill and change the
                        currency of the bill.

                           in Oracle Fusion Receivables. A bill receivable is a document that
                           a customer formally agrees to pay at some future date (the maturity
                           date).

                           bill. Bills receivable are often remitted for collection and used
                           to secure short term funding.

                              process. On the bill receivable maturity date, the bank collects payment
                              in full from your customers and transfers the funds directly to your
                              bank account, less any fees or other charges. With standard remittances,
                              you bear the financial risk of customer default.

                              from your bank. Oracle Fusion Receivables creates a receipt for the
                              bill receivable upon remittance. If the bill receivable is factored
                              with recourse, you bear the financial risk of customer default, and
                              Receivables records a short term debt for the default risk. If the
                              bill receivable is factored without recourse, the bank assumes the
                              risk of customer default, and Receivables closes the bill upon creation
                              of the remittance.

                        remittance receipt method assigned to the receipt class determines
                        the accounting for the bills receivable. Receivables selects qualifying
                        bills receivable for remittance and groups them according to the remittance
                        bank that is assigned to each bill. You can specify additional selection

                           from the drawee by the maturity date, then Receivables performs these

                           collection days.

                     <p>For bills receivable factored with recourse, you
                        bear the financial risk of customer default. When you create a bill
                        receivable factored with recourse, Oracle Fusion Receivables records
                        a short term debt for the default risk. The bills receivable remittance
                        receipt method assigns the number of risk elimination days to the
                        bill. The risk elimination days are the number of days after the bill
                        receivable maturity date that you can clear short term debt on your
                        factored bills receivable.

                     <p>Receivables applies receipts created at the time
                        of remittance to bills receivable and eliminates the risk on each
                        bill. The apply date is the bill receivable maturity date plus the
                        number of risk elimination days.

                              bill receivable at the maturity date plus risk elimination days. The

                           Risk</span> action to manually eliminate risk on a bill receivable.
                        You can do this, for example, if payment is received from the customer
                        during the risk elimination period.

                        after risk has been eliminated, you can use the <span class="uicontrol">Reestablish Risk</span> action to reestablish risk on the bill.
                        When you reestablish risk on a Closed bill receivable that was factored
                        with recourse, Receivables unapplies the receipt that was created
                        when the bill was factored and applies the receipt to short term debt.
                        The status of the bill is updated to Matured Pending Risk Elimination.

                              with Recourse and then Closed as Unpaid, Receivables reverses the

                           Unpaid. You can later release the bill receivable from hold and make

                           Once the protest is resolved, you can either mark the bill as Unpaid
                           again or, if applicable, apply a customer receipt to the protested
