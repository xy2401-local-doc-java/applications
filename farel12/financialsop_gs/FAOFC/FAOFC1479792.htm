                     <p>Run the Recognize Revenue program to generate
                        the revenue distribution records for invoices and credit memos that
                        use invoicing and revenue scheduling rules. Revenue scheduling rules
                        determine the number of periods and the percentage of total revenue
                        to record in each accounting period. Invoicing rules determine when
                        to recognize the receivable for invoices that span more than one accounting
                        period.

                     <p>The Recognize Revenue program selects all transactions
                        that have invoicing and revenue scheduling rules and that haven't
                        yet been processed since the last submission of the program. This
                        includes new transactions, unprocessed transactions, and partially
                        processed transactions. The Recognize Revenue program creates the
                        revenue distribution records for all accounting periods specified
                        by the revenue scheduling rule on each transaction line.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Creating Revenue Distributions</h4>
                        
                        <p>The Recognize Revenue program creates distribution
                           records for invoices and credit memos both created manually and imported
                           using AutoInvoice. The Recognize Revenue program uses the accounting
                           distributions defined by AutoAccounting to determine the accounts
                           for the revenue distribution records. If a transaction contains a
                           deferred revenue scheduling rule, then the Recognize Revenue program
                           instead creates the distribution records for the specified unearned
                           revenue account. Deferred revenue is later recognized according to
                           the contingencies associated with the particular transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>During the import of revenue lines by Oracle Fusion
                           Costing, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) is recognized or deferred in the
                           same percentage as revenue. COGS is the expense of manufacturing that
                           is associated with the sale of goods.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The Recognize Revenue program also creates the receivable,
                           tax, freight, and AutoInvoice clearing account assignments which correspond
                           to the accounting date of each transaction included in the program
                           submission.

                           The Recognize Revenue program creates accounting distributions
                           for all periods of status Open, Future, or Not Open. If any period
                           has a status of Closed or Close Pending, then the Recognize Revenue
                           program creates the distributions in the next Open, Future, or Not
                           Open period.
                           
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>If you later decide that the revenue distributions
                           need to be reclassified, you can update the individual revenue distribution
                           on the transaction. Oracle Fusion Receivables automatically creates
                           the necessary reverse accounting entries.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Each run of the Recognize Revenue program generates
                           a Revenue Recognition Execution report. Use this report to review
                           the details of revenue recognition on your transactions, as well as
                           any records that failed processing.

                        <p>The Revenue Recognition Execution report contains
                           a section called Unprocessed or Partially Processed Transactions,
                           for transactions that failed processing for revenue recognition.

                        <p>A transaction can fail revenue recognition processing
                           either partially or completely:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Partially Processed Transactions:
                                 If some but not all of the transaction lines are successfully processed,
                                 then the transaction appears as Partially Processed. For example,
                                 if processing succeeded for lines 1 and 2 of an invoice that has 3
                                 invoice lines, the report displays one record for line number 3 with
                                 the accompanying line details.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Unprocessed Transactions: If all
                                 of the transaction lines weren't processed, then the transaction appears
                                 as Unprocessed. For example, if processing failed for all 3 lines
                                 of an invoice, the report displays three record entries, one for each
                                 line, with the accompanying line details.
                              </p>

                        <p>The main reason for failure to process revenue on
                           a transaction or transaction line is data corruption on the transaction.
                           Two examples of data corruption are:

                     <h3>Deferred and Non-Deferred Revenue Scheduling Rules: Examples</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Revenue scheduling rules determine the number
                        of accounting periods and percentage of total revenue to record in
                        each accounting period for a transaction. When you use deferred revenue
                        scheduling rules, the Recognize Revenue program creates a single distribution
                        per line that posts to an unearned revenue account. You later earn
                        the revenue either when a contingency expires or by manually scheduling
                        the revenue.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You can use deferred revenue scheduling rules only
                        for invoices that are assigned the In Advance invoicing rule. If you
                        use a deferred revenue scheduling rule with a single accounting period,
                        Oracle Fusion Receivables recognizes the revenue in the period that
                        you specify.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you use a deferred revenue scheduling rule with
                        multiple accounting periods, Receivables creates the revenue recognition
                        schedule based on the rule, and the start date is determined by the
                        accounting start date that you provide. If the accounting start date
                        occurs in a closed accounting period, Receivables posts that portion
                        of revenue into the subsequent open accounting period.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you use a non-deferred revenue scheduling rule
                        with multiple accounting periods, Receivables uses the schedule created
                        by the Recognize Revenue program. If an accounting period is closed,
                        Receivables posts that portion of revenue into the subsequent open
                        accounting period.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following examples illustrate revenue recognition
                        with deferred and non-deferred revenue scheduling rules.

                        <p>The February 2 row shows what the original revenue
                           recognition schedule is if the revenue scheduling rule is not deferred.
                           However, because the rule is deferred, Receivables creates a single
                           distribution line that posts to an unearned revenue account when you
                           run the Recognize Revenue program.
                        </p>
                        <p>You can then earn the revenue on this invoice, but
                           you enter March 2 as the accounting start date. Receivables honors
                           the original schedule, illustrated by the February 2 row, but ignores
                           the original start date from the transaction and uses the March 2
                           accounting date that you entered. This causes Receivables to shift
                           the schedule by one month, as illustrated by the March 2 row.

                           schedule that Receivables creates when you first run the Recognize
                           Revenue program. At this stage, February is open.

                           rules, Receivables uses the original schedule, as illustrated by the

                        <p>If you set up a revenue policy, Oracle Fusion
                           Receivables assigns revenue contingencies to any transaction or transaction
                           line that violates the policy, and defers revenue on these transactions

                                 to the transaction and only recognizes revenue after the refund policy
                                 period expires.

                           not normally track sales credits, and you want to use revenue accounting
                           for revenue adjustments only, use the default salesperson value of
                           No Sales Credit.

                                 revenue scheduling rule exists on an invoice, then Receivables further
                                 prorates the credit memo amount across future periods.

                           revenue that was already manually adjusted, then Receivables follows
                           standard credit memo functionality. Receivables prorates the credit
                           memo amount between the earned and unearned revenue amounts on the

                        <ul>

                              <p>Payment-based contingencies: If you
                                 apply a receipt to an invoice with a payment-based contingency, Receivables
                                 initiates revenue recognition for the applied amount. If you later
                                 reverse the receipt, Receivables automatically unearns the previously
                                 earned revenue.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Time-based contingencies: If you
                                 apply a receipt against an invoice line with an unexpired time-based
                                 contingency, Receivables leaves the receipt amount as unearned revenue,
                                 but marks the amount as pending revenue recognition when the contingency
                                 expires. If you later reverse the receipt, then Receivables reflects
                                 the receipt reversal by simply removing the pending status from the
                                 receipt amount.
                              </p>
                              <p>If revenue on an invoice was deferred
                                 due to unexpired time-based contingencies only, then the reversal
                                 of a receipt does not impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.
                                 For example, if all lines of an invoice are associated with a nonstandard
                                 refund policy (90 days), Receivables recognizes revenue only upon
                                 the expiration of the 90-day period. Applying and later reversing
                                 a receipt against this invoice has no impact on the timing and amount
                                 of revenue recognition.

                     <p>If multiple contingencies exist on multiple
                        invoice lines, then revenue recognition can occur at different times
                        for different lines on the invoice. If multiple contingencies exist
                        on a single invoice line, then revenue recognition for that line occurs
                        only after the latest contingency expires.

                        <p>Since payment in full was received and applied against
                           the invoice, Receivables recognizes the revenue by debiting $600 from

                           Because the customer is not creditworthy, Receivables can recognize
                           revenue only to the extent of the applied receipt. Because this is
                           a partial receipt, Receivables must calculate how much revenue to
                           attribute to each invoice line.
                        </p>
                        <p>When applying a partial receipt, Receivables uses
                           a weighted average formula to calculate the revenue amounts to recognize
                           for each line. Receivables calculates the revenue for each line as

                        </ul>
                        <p>Since the $400 receipt is a partial payment, Receivables
                           prorates this payment across the invoice lines, based on the weighted
                           average formula. However, for simplicity, assume that Receivables
                           applies $80 to each invoice line:
                        </p>

                              <p>Receivables recognizes revenue for
                                 Lines 1, 2, and 4 in the amount of $80 each.
                              </p>

                              <p>Receivables can't recognize revenue
                                 for Lines 3 and 5 due to the unexpired time-based contingencies. Receivables
                                 therefore marks the $80 payments for Lines 3 and 5 as amounts that
                                 are pending revenue recognition at a later date.
                              </p>

                        <p>When the contingencies later expire, Receivables recognizes
                           revenue for Lines 3 and 5 in the amount of $80 each. Any future receipts
                           applied against this invoice are analyzed in the same way.

                           After reviewing the original invoice 1001, Receivables determines

                        <p>Revenue is scheduled when Oracle Fusion Receivables
                           creates, for a transaction line, the revenue distribution records

                           rule assigned to each line. Scheduled revenue doesn't mean that the
                           revenue amounts are already earned. It means only that Receivables
                           has created the distribution records for these amounts.

                           recognition of previously deferred revenue, for example, the customer
