                           If you enter an invoice with rules, the account distributions
                           are not built when the invoice is first created. Instead the RA_CUST_TRX_LINE_GL_DIST
                           table stores an account set, which represents how the actual distribution
                           rows should be created and what percentage of the actual distribution
                           should be allocated to each account. Account sets can be identified
                           by a Y in the account_set_flag column. The actual distribution records
                           are built when you run revenue recognition.

                           status of Invoice I-101. The invoice has a status of OP (open) and
                           an amount_applied of NULL, because no payment has been applied against
                           it. Once payment is received in full, the status will change to CL
                           (closed), the amount_applied will change to 6400, and the amount_due_remaining
                           will be zero.

                        <p>Receivables uses the AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS table
                           to store the mapping of the credit memo to the invoice being credited.
                           The payment_schedule_id and customer_trx_id columns contain the credit
                           memo data, while the applied_payment_schedule_id and applied_customer_trx_id
                           reference the original invoice. If the credit memo applies to an invoice
                           with multiple payment schedules, a record is inserted into AR_RECEIVABLE_APPLICATIONS
                           for each payment schedule of the invoice. The code_combination_id
                           column, which is not shown, stores the receivable account of the invoice.
                           However, when the transaction is posted to the general ledger it posts
                           as two distributions. One entry is posted to the receivable account
                           of the credit memo, as it is stored in the RA_CUST_TRX_LINE_GL_DIST
                           table, and the other entry is posted to the receivable account of
                           the invoice, as it is stored in the RA_CUST_TRX_LINE_GL_DIST table.
                        </p>
                        <p>For a standard credit memo, the receivable account
                           of the credit memo is debited, while the receivable account of the
                           invoice is credited. Normally, the receivable accounts will be the
                           same, but this process permits the flexibility of using a unique receivable
                           account to record your credit memos.

                           table. The customer_trx_id and the payment_schedule_id columns reference

                           the amount_due_remaining column by the amount applied. Since the entire
                           amount is applied, the amount_due_remaining is zero. The status of

                           APP, stores the applied receipt information, including a reference
                           to the applied invoice, via the trx_number column.

                           ledger account associated with unapplied receipts. For the APP record,
                           the code_combination_id is the receivable account associated with
                           the invoice transaction to which this receipt is applied.

                           the code_combination_id is the receivable account associated with
                           the invoice transaction to which this receipt is applied.

                        interest tiers. If you don't use charge schedules, then when your
                        late charge policy changes you must update each of your applicable
                        customer profiles with the new rates.

                        Because Oracle Fusion Receivables treats interest
                        invoices and debit memos as regular transactions, tax may be calculated
                        on these transaction amounts.

                        to calculate and collect late charges for small amounts, you can set
                        a minimum customer balance for late charges.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>You set a minimum customer balance per currency on

                        the minimum customer balance using the Overdue Transactions Only charge
                        calculation method and the Average Daily Balance charge calculation
                        method. In these examples, the minimum customer balance is $250.

                        Oracle Fusion Receivables that has an accounting impact. For example,
                        creating or applying a receipt is an accounting event.

                     <p>Not all business events have an accounting impact,
                        but you can decide which events you want to monitor as accounting
                        events. You can modify the accounting setup to create accounting for
                        some events and not for others.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Subledger Accounting categorizes accounting
                        events as event types. Event types are grouped into event classes
                        that in turn are grouped into event entities. The overall grouping
                        of these components is called an event model. The Receivables accounting
                        event model is predefined for you, and includes each Receivables event
                        class and its life cycle. This accounting event model forms the basis
                        for creating subledger accounting.

                     <p>As the foundation of the event model, Receivables
                        predefines event entities. An event entity enables Subledger Accounting
                        to handle the accounting for similar business events in a consistent
                        manner. The event entities for Receivables are:

                     <p>Each event entity is associated with one or more event
                        classes. An event class represents a category of business events for
                        a particular activity or document. Event classes group similar event
                        types and enable the sharing of accounting definitions.

                     <p>An event type represents a business operation that
                        you can perform for an event class. An accounting event has both an
                        event class and an event type that affect how the Create Receivables
                        Accounting program determines the subledger accounting for it. Event
                        types provide the lowest level of detail for storing accounting definitions.

                        extract and report help to simplify this process and reduce the amount

                        A review of some of these setups can help improve the overall reconciliation

                           to your business unit, you can reconcile based on business unit. This
                           allows employees from different business units to balance their respective

                           This is a business decision, and your setup in Receivables should
                           be such that the default accounting assigned to activities for that
                           business unit should be the primary balancing segment value that was

                        <p>You must assign the financial category of Accounts
                           Receivable to all of your receivables natural account values. This
                           is a required setup step for Receivables to general ledger reconciliation.
                           You perform this task under the Manage Chart of Accounts Value Sets
                           activity.

                           not included in the chart of accounts setup, the Receivables to General
                           Ledger Reconciliation report won't select any data. When you run the
                           extract program, if you try to select general ledger natural account
                           values that don't have this category assigned, the extract program

                        <p>Once you assign the Accounts Receivable financial
                           category, you can leave the <span class="uicontrol">Account</span> parameter blank when you run the extract, in order to include all

                           to limit the report to reconciling only a subset of the receivables
                           accounts in the ledger, but these values must have the Accounts Receivable

                           in order to include them in reconciliation. If you want to exclude
                           these accounts during reconciliation, then you must exclude them from

                                 period. The default is the latest period in the Closed Pending status,

                              <p>You can run the extract on an Open period to see
                                 point-in-time summary balances, in order to review possible reconciling
                                 activities you may encounter during period close processing. If you
                                 select an Open period for reconciliation, users can still enter activity
                                 against the period after the extract runs, creating potential discrepancies
                                 between the summary and detail information on the report. Best practice
                                 is to close the accounting period to be reconciled before you run
                                 the extract, and then select this Closed period in the <span class="uicontrol">Accounting Period</span> parameter.

                                 You may want to exclude unapplied and unidentified
                                 receipts if they typically post to non-receivable accounts. If you
                                 plan to exclude unapplied and unidentified receipts, you also need
                                 to exclude the related general ledger account in the <span class="uicontrol">Account</span> parameter. Therefore, don't post

                     <p>Use the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation
                        report to facilitate the reconciliation of receivables data to the
                        general ledger.

                     <p>The interactive reporting capability of the Receivables
                        to General Ledger Reconciliation report provides both summarized and
                        detailed reconciling data for review. The Summary report lets you
                        see receivables and accounting beginning and ending balances, as well
                        as summarized activity for the period and how this activity was accounted.

                     <p>Drill down on any amount in the Summary report <span class="uicontrol">Difference</span> column to display the Differences
                        Detail report for that item. The Differences Detail reports display
                        the details that make up balances from the Summary report, and indicate
                        potential causes for differences between actual and reconciling amounts.

                        For a more efficient reconciliation, don't allow general
                        ledger sources other than Oracle Fusion Receivables to post to Receivables
                        accounts.

                     <p>If you restrict the number of general ledger accounts
                        that you include in a run of the Prepare Receivables to General Ledger
                        Reconciliation program, this can affect the display of data in the
                        detail reports and may be the cause of a difference between the accounted
                        amount of a transaction and the reconciling amount.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, if Receivables transactions are recorded
                        against balancing segment values 1, 2, 3 or natural accounts A, B,
                        C, and the account range you used excluded some of these values, then
                        these transactions would show up as differences on the report.

                     <p>If you are downloading a large amount of data from
                        the report to a spreadsheet and you plan to perform a number of data
                        manipulations, use the CSV format. If you are downloading data for
                        reference purposes only, use the Excel or PDF format.

                           you don't post these receipts to a receivables account or an account
                           with the financial category of Accounts Receivable assigned, then
                           these receipts appear as a difference that is outside the account
                           range of the report. In this case, you may wish to re-run the extract
                           and exclude these items.

                           journal lines dated in previous fiscal years, which means that these
                           journal lines won't match the Non-Receivables Begin Balance amount.
                           The drilldown page is only intended to provide current fiscal year
                           journals that might have posted erroneously to the receivables account.

                           not Receivables. However, you may see manual subledger journal entries
                           that were entered for the Receivables source directly into the subledger
                           but not necessarily linked to a specific Receivables transaction.
                           Most of these entries represent adjustment journal entries.

                        <p>Manual subledger journals created during the current
                           reconciling period display in the Summary report under Other Accounting,
                           and become part of the Non-Receivables Begin Balance amount in subsequent
                           periods. Manual general ledger journals that may affect receivables
                           accounts are created directly in the general ledger and don't display
                           under Other Accounting on the Summary report, but display instead
                           under the Non-Receivables Activity amount.

                                 limit the display of intercompany transactions on the Receivables
                                 Aging by Account report. If the reconciliation extract either excludes
                                 intercompany transactions or displays intercompany transactions only,
                                 then the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation report and the
                                 Receivables Aging by Account report won't display compatible data.

                                 In this case, compare the Accounting End Balance with the Receivables
                                 Aging by Account report. You will need to subtract out any amount
                                 in Other Accounting, as this is not included in the Receivables Aging
                                 by Account report.

                                 All customer transactions applied to bills receivable created, accepted,
                                 and canceled during the accounting period.

                        <p>The totals for Bills Receivable and Bills Receivable
                           Application net to zero, because both sides of the creation of bills
                           receivable and the application of transactions, or unapplication in
                           the case of canceled bills, are recorded here. Creation and Acceptance
                           require the assignment of transactions to the bill receivable, so
                           each of these bills display the associated transaction applications.
                           Cancellation reverses the bill receivable and its applications, so
                           canceled bills display both sides of the activity, application and
                           unapplication.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Status changes to Remitted, Unpaid, and Factored
                           bills receivable have an accounting impact only because, as the bill
                           goes through its lifecycle, only the account it posts to changes.
                           These events display in the Summary report under Other Accounting.
                           Like all other events related to reconciliation, the accounts used
                           for these activities need to have the financial category of Accounts
                           Receivable assigned to the natural account segment in the chart of
                           accounts.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Other activities against bills receivable are included
                           in existing sections of the Summary report and the related drilldown
                           reports. On-account credit memos against a bill receivable display
                           in the Invoices section, along with all other transaction activity.
                           Receipts applied to bills receivable display with other receipts in
                           the Applied Receipts section.

                        <p>During the internal reconciliation process,
                           you use the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation Report to
                           confirm that transactional data and accounting data match. However,
                           even if the data matches, the journals could still post to incorrect
                           general ledger accounts, due to issues with your Receivables setup.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Use the Potential Reconciling Items Report to help
                           you identify and correct these setup issues.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You typically run the Potential Reconciling Items
                           Report:

                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>For new software installations,
                                 prior to running final accounting, in order to confirm the correct
                                 derivation of accounting.

                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Whenever the accounting setup has
                                 been modified--such as the creation of new transaction types, receipt
                                 methods or receivables activities--prior to running final accounting.
                              </p>

                        <p>The report suggests journal items that potentially
                           posted to general ledger accounts with unexpected account types, thus
                           creating reconciliation issues in general ledger. An unexpected account
                           type refers to general ledger account types that are not normally
                           associated with an item general ledger category. General ledger account
                           types used by Receivables include assets, liabilities, income, and
                           expense.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, a receivable item might be expected
                           to post to an asset account. If the item posts to a non-asset account,
                           then it will appear on the Potential Reconciling Items Report.

                           Report to revalue your open items, including invoices, credit memos,
                           and debit memos. The report takes into account changes in the value
                           of your receivables due to changes in foreign currency rates. You
                           revalue open items based on the revaluation rate that you specify,
                           which is either an end-of-period rate or a daily rate.

                                 your general ledger balances. The report also provides a complete
                                 list of all open items and explains the balance of your receivables
                                 account.

                              <p>Revaluation Open Amount: The value
                                 for each revalued open item with the revaluation rate. This itemized
                                 total is required in some countries.

                                 of the two item values both before and after the revaluation. The
                                 report adds up these values and calculates the difference. This total
                                 is required in some countries, where the lower market value of open
                                 items needs to be determined.

                           section, the report lists open items for each customer.

                        <p>The Receivables Open Items Revaluation Report determines
                           the amount needed to manually adjust your general ledger balance to
                           reflect the difference between the original and revalued balance.
                           This revaluation difference is calculated and summarized for each
                           accounting flexfield. You should reverse this adjustment at the beginning
                           of the next period to synchronize Receivables and General Ledger balances.

                           result of data corruption either in subledger accounting or the general
                           ledger. Variance amounts don't display in any other section of the

                        to adjust the general ledger balance for these customers.

                              of your customer and the open items that make up the balance. It takes
                              into account on-account receipts.

                              or both positive and negative balances, depending on the setting of

                        the difference between the original balance and the revaluated balance.
                        You would then reverse this entry at the beginning of the following
