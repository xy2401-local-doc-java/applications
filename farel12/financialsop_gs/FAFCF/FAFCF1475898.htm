      parameters. In the configuration package created for the implementation project, parameters passed to a setup task are also
      passed to the business objects being moved. As a result, the scope of the setup tasks is maintained intact during the movement.
      Common reference objects may have internal references or dependencies among other common reference objects. Therefore, you
      must note all the dependencies before moving the objects so that there are no broken references among them."><script>window.ohcglobal || document.write('<script src="/en/dcommon/js/global.js">\x3C/script>')</script></head>

                  <p>A Configuration Package contains the setup
                     import and export definition. The setup import and export definition
                     is the list of setup tasks and their associated business objects that
                     identifies the setup data for export as well as the data itself. When
                     you create a configuration package only the setup export and import
                     definition exists. Once you submit export, a snapshot of the appropriate
                     setup data is added to the configuration package using the definition.
                     You can continue making modifications to the setup data in the environment
                     and create a new configuration package any time you need it.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>You can generate the setup export and import definition
                     implicitly or explicitly:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>A configuration package is created
                           implicitly when you export setup data for an entire offering or any
                           functional area from the Applications Administration page. 
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>A configuration package is created
                           explicitly when you export setup data based on an implementation project.
                           This method enables further customization of the configuration packages.
                        </p>

                  </ul>
                  
                  <p> You generate the setup export and import definition
                     by selecting an implementation project and creating a configuration
                     package. The tasks and their associated business objects in the selected
                     implementation project define the setup export and import definition
                     for the configuration package. In addition, the sequence of the tasks
                     in the implementation project determines the export and import sequence.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The tasks and their associated business objects in
                     the selected configuration (offering, functional area or implementation
                     project) define the setup export and import definition for the configuration
                     package. In addition, the sequence of the tasks in the implementation
                     project determines the export and import sequence.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Once a configuration package is exported, the setup
                     export and import definition is locked and cannot be changed; that
                     is, you cannot change the selection (add or remove) of tasks and their
                     associated business objects, change their export and import sequence,
                     nor the scope value selection. However, you can create a new configuration
                     package with such modifications at any time.
                  </p>

                  <p>Use an implementation project as the source
                     for exporting setup data when you are required to customize the list
                     of tasks or of objects you want to export setup data for.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>You must explicitly create a configuration package
                     from the Manage Configuration Packages page to export setup data for
                     an implementation project. You generate the setup export and import
                     definition by selecting an implementation project and creating a configuration
                     package. The tasks and their associated business objects in the selected
                     implementation project define the setup export and import definition
                     for the configuration package.  Depending on your needs, when you
                     create a configuration package based on an implementation project,
                     you can also customize some additional aspects, as explained here.
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Exclude some of the business objects
                           from the configuration you selected to export setup data for.  
                        </p>
                        <p>You should limit to use this option when the corresponding
                           setup data is already available in the target instance and therefore
                           no data dependency issues appear during import.
                        </p>
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Change the default import sequence
                           of the business objects
                        </p>
                        <p>Change the default import
                           sequence of the business objects. It's strongly recommended that you
                           limit using this option when you need to correct a data dependency
                           issue and you fully understand the data relationships between the
                           business objects of your configuration.

                     <p> During export, appropriate setup data is identified
                        based on the tasks in the implementation project used as source for
                        the configuration package.  The setup data in the configuration package
                        is a snapshot of the data in the source application instance at the
                        time of export. Once export completes, you can download the configuration
                        package file as a zipped archive of multiple XML files, move it to
                        the target application instance, and upload and import it. After exporting
                        the setup data you may continue entering new or modifying existing
                        setup data for your configuration. Since the configuration package
                        is a snapshot of the setup data taken at the time export is initiated,
                        you may need to take another snapshot of the same configuration or
                        set of data later. Although you can always create a different configuration
                        package, FSM provides you the ability to take another snapshot of
                        the setup data using the same customized export and import definition
                        by exporting the configuration package multiple times and creating
                        multiple versions. While the export definition remains the same in
                        each version, the setup data can be different if you modified the
                        data in the time period between the different runs of the export process.
                        Since each version of the configuration package has a snapshot of
                        the data in the source instance, you can compare and analyze various
                        versions of the configuration package to see how the setup data changed.
                     </p>

                     <p>During import, you first upload a configuration package
                        created by the export process and then import the setup data. All
                        setup data contained in the configuration package is imported into
                        the environment you initiate the setup data import from. In the target
                        application instance, the setup import process inserts all new data
                        from the source configuration package that does not already exist,
                        and update any existing data with changes from the source. Setup data
                        that exists in the target instance but not in source will remain unchanged.

                           created for the implementation project, parameters passed to a setup
                           task are also passed to the business objects being moved. As a result,
                           the scope of the setup tasks is maintained intact during the movement.

                           In scenarios where there may be dependencies on other
                           objects, you must move the dependencies before moving the referencing
                           object. For example, if data security policies have dependencies on
                           newly created security roles, you must move the security roles before
                           moving the security policies.

                     <h3>Using Seed Data Framework to Move Common Reference Objects: Points to Consider</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>To move the common reference objects, you
                        can use the Seed Data Framework (SDF). You can also use the command
                        line interface of SDF to move the object setup data. For more information
                        about seed data loaders including common reference object loaders,
                        see Oracle Fusion Applications Developer's Guide.
                     </p>

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Movement Dependencies</h4>
                        
                        <p>The seed data interface moves only the setup metadata.
                           For example, if you use SDF to import flexfield metadata, the flexfield
                           setup metadata is imported into your database. However, you must initiate
                           the flexfield deployment process separately after seed data import
                           to regenerate the runtime flexfield artifacts in the target environment.
                           Similarly, if you use SDF to import data security metadata, you must
                           first move any new referenced roles and then manually run the GUID
                           reconciliation where required.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>To ensure that the reference data is not lost during
                           the movement, certain guidelines are prescribed. It is recommended
                           that you perform the movement of object data exactly in the order
                           given below.
                        </p>
