      The decisions about your implementation of Oracle Fusion Applications are affected by your: The figure above shows a typical
      group of legal entities, operating various business and functional organizations. Your ability to buy and sell, own, and employ
      comes from your charter in the legal system. A corporation is: Successfully managing multiple businesses requires that you
      segregate them by their strategic objectives, and measure their results. Although related to your legal structure, the business
      organizational hierarchies do not have to be reflected directly in the legal structure of the enterprise. The management structure
      can include divisions, subdivisions, lines of business, strategic business units, profit, and cost centers. In the figure
      above, the management structure is shown on the Business Axis. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the management structure is
      implemented using divisions and business units as well as being reflected in the chart of accounts. Straddling the legal and
      business organizations is a functional organization structured around people and their competencies. For example, sales, manufacturing,
      and service teams are functional organizations. This functional structure is represented by the Functional Axis in the figure
      above. You reflect the efforts and expenses of your functional organizations directly on the income statement. Organizations
      must manage and report revenues, cost of sales, and functional expenses such as research and development and selling, general,
      and administrative expenses. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the functional structure is implemented using departments and
      organizations, including sales, marketing, project, cost, and inventory organizations. The Enterprise Structures Configurator
      is an interview-based tool that guides you through the process of setting up a basic enterprise structure. By answering questions
      about your enterprise, the tool creates a structure of divisions, legal entities, business units, and reference data sets
      that reflects your enterprise structure. After you create your enterprise structure, you also follow a guided process to determine
      whether to use positions, and whether to set up additional attributes for jobs and positions. After you define your enterprise
      structure and your job and position structures, you can review them, make any necessary changes, and then load the final configuration."><script>window.ohcglobal || document.write('<script src="/en/dcommon/js/global.js">\x3C/script>')</script></head>

                     <p>Many large enterprises isolate risk and optimize taxes
                        by incorporating subsidiaries. They create legal entities to facilitate
                        legal compliance, segregate operations, optimize taxes, complete contractual
                        relationships, and isolate risk. Enterprises use legal entities to
                        establish their enterprise's identity under the laws of each country
                        in which their enterprise operates.

                        UK, and France companies. The list of business divisions is on the

                        by functional groups, such as the sales team and the finance team.
                        This functional list is called the Functional Axis. The overall image
                        suggests that information might, at a minimum, be tracked by company,
                        business, division, and function in a group environment. In Oracle
                        Fusion Applications, the legal structure is implemented using legal
                        entities.

                     <p>Successfully managing multiple businesses
                        requires that you segregate them by their strategic objectives, and
                        measure their results. Although related to your legal structure, the
                        business organizational hierarchies do not have to be reflected directly
                        in the legal structure of the enterprise. The management structure
                        can include divisions, subdivisions, lines of business, strategic
                        business units, profit, and cost centers. In the figure above, the
                        management structure is shown on the Business Axis. In Oracle Fusion
                        Applications, the management structure is implemented using divisions
                        and business units as well as being reflected in the chart of accounts.

                        For example, sales, manufacturing, and service teams are functional
                        organizations. This functional structure is represented by the Functional
                        Axis in the figure above. You reflect the efforts and expenses of
                        your functional organizations directly on the income statement. Organizations
                        must manage and report revenues, cost of sales, and functional expenses
                        such as research and development and selling, general, and administrative
                        expenses. In Oracle Fusion Applications, the functional structure
                        is implemented using departments and organizations, including sales,
                        marketing, project, cost, and inventory organizations.

                     <p>The Enterprise Structures Configurator is
                        an interview-based tool that guides you through the process of setting
                        up a basic enterprise structure. By answering questions about your
                        enterprise, the tool creates a structure of divisions, legal entities,
                        business units, and reference data sets that reflects your enterprise
                        structure. After you create your enterprise structure, you also follow
                        a guided process to determine whether to use positions, and whether
                        to set up additional attributes for jobs and positions. After you
                        define your enterprise structure and your job and position structures,
                        you can review them, make any necessary changes, and then load the

                        in the offerings, and you can't create multiple configurations to

                        <p>A division refers to a business-oriented subdivision
                           within an enterprise, in which each division organizes itself differently
                           to deliver products and services or address different markets. A division
                           can operate in one or more countries, and can be many companies or
                           parts of different companies that are represented by business units.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>A division is a profit center or grouping of profit
                           and cost centers, where the division manager is responsible for achieving
                           business goals including profits. A division can be responsible for
                           a share of the company's existing product lines or for a separate
                           business. Managers of divisions may also have return on investment
                           goals requiring tracking of the assets and liabilities of the division.
                           The division manager generally reports to a top corporate executive.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>By definition a division can be represented in the
                           chart of accounts. Companies can use product lines, brands, or geographies
                           as their divisions: their choice represents the primary organizing
                           principle of the enterprise. This may coincide with the management
                           segment used in segment reporting.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Oracle Fusion Applications supports a qualified management
                           segment and recommends that you use this segment to represent your
                           hierarchy of business units and divisions. If managers of divisions
                           have return on investment goals, make the management segment a balancing
                           segment. Oracle Fusion applications permit up to three balancing segments.
                           The values of the management segment can be business units that roll
                           up in a hierarchy to report by division.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Historically, divisions were implemented as a node
                           in a hierarchy of segment values. For example, Oracle E-Business Suite
                           has only one balancing segment, and often the division and legal entity
                           are combined into a single segment where each value stands for both
                           division and legal entity.

                        <p>Legal entities must comply with the regulations of
                           jurisdictions, in which they register. Europe now allows for companies
                           to register in one member country and do business in all member countries,
                           and the US allows for companies to register in one state and do business
                           in all states. To support local reporting requirements, legal reporting
                           units are created and registered.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You are required to publish specific and periodic
                           disclosures of your legal entities' operations based on different
                           jurisdictions' requirements. Certain annual or more frequent accounting
                           reports are referred to as statutory or external reporting. These
                           reports must be filed with specified national and regulatory authorities.
                           For example, in the United States (US), your publicly owned entities
                           (corporations) are required to file quarterly and annual reports,
                           as well as other periodic reports, with the Securities and Exchange
                           Commission (SEC), which enforces statutory reporting requirements
                           for public corporations.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Individual entities privately held or held by public
                           companies do not have to file separately. In other countries, your
                           individual entities do have to file in their own name, as well as
                           at the public group level. Disclosure requirements are diverse. For
                           example, your local entities may have to file locally to comply with
                           local regulations in a local currency, as well as being included in
                           your enterprise's reporting requirements in different currency.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>A legal entity can represent all or part of your
                           enterprise's management framework. For example, if you operate in
                           a large country such as the United Kingdom or Germany, you might incorporate
                           each division in the country as a separate legal entity. In a smaller
                           country, for example Austria, you might use a single legal entity
                           to host all of your business operations across divisions.

                        (ESC), to create legal
                        entities for your enterprise automatically, based on the countries
                        in which divisions of your business operate, or you can upload a list
                        of legal entities from a spreadsheet.

                           entities that you need, you can create them automatically. To use
                           this option, you first identify all of the countries in which your
                           enterprise operates. The application opens the Map Divisions by Country
                           page, which contains a matrix of the countries that you identified,
                           your enterprise, and the divisions that you created. You select the check boxes
                           where your enterprise and divisions intersect with the countries to
                           identify the legal entities that you want the application to create.
                           The enterprise is included for situations where your enterprise operates
                           in a country, acts on behalf of several divisions within the enterprise,
                           and is a legal employer in a country. If you select the enterprise
                           for a country, the application creates a country holding company.

                        <p>The application automatically creates the legal entities
                           that you select, and identifies them as payroll statutory units and legal employers. For each country that you indicated that your enterprise operates
                           in, and for each country that you created a location for, the application
                           also automatically creates a legislative data group.

                        <p>Any legal entities that you create automatically cannot
                           be deleted from the Create Legal Entities page within the Enterprise
                           Structures Configurator. You must return to the Map Divisions by Country
                           page and deselect the legal entities that you no longer want.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Applications support the modeling
                        of your legal entities. If you make purchases from or sell to other legal entities, define
                        these other legal entities in your customer and supplier registers.
                        These registers are part of the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Architecture.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When your legal entities are trading with each other,
                        represent them as legal entities and as customers and suppliers in
                        your customer and supplier registers. Use legal entity relationships
                        to determine which transactions are intercompany and require intercompany
                        accounting. Your legal entities can be identified as legal employers
                        and therefore, are available for use in Human Capital Management (HCM)
                        applications.

                        <p>For example, a sales order creates an obligation

                           acknowledged date. The creation also creates an obligation on the

                           and revaluation reserves must be reflected in your legal entity's
                           accounts. In Oracle Fusion Applications, your inventory within an
                           inventory organization is managed by a single business unit and belongs

                        <p>A business unit  can process transactions on behalf of many

                           entity. In most cases, the legal entity is explicit on your transactions.
                           For example, a payables invoice has an explicit legal entity field.
                           Your accounts payables department can process supplier invoices on
                           behalf of one or many business units.

                           Business Unit ACM UK has a default legal entity of InFusion UK Ltd.
                           When a purchase order is placed in ACM UK, the legal entity InFusion
                           UK Ltd is legally obligated to the supplier. Oracle Fusion Procurement,
                           Oracle Fusion Project Portfolio Management, and Oracle Fusion Supply
                           Chain applications rely on deriving the legal entity information from

                        <p>Oracle Fusion General Ledger supports up to
                           three balancing
                           segments. Best practices recommend one segment represents your

                           to regulatory agencies, tax authorities, and investors. Accounting
                           for your operations means you must produce a balanced trial balance
                           sheet by legal entity. If you account for many legal entities in a
                           single ledger, you must:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ol>

                           <li>
                              <p>Balance transactions that cross legal
                                 entity boundaries through intercompany transactions.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Decide which balancing segments correspond
                                 to each legal entity and assign them in Oracle Fusion General Ledger
                                 Accounting Configuration Manager. Once you assign one balancing segment
                                 value in a ledger, then all your balancing segment values must be
                                 assigned. This recommended best practice facilitates reporting on
                                 assets, liabilities, and income by legal entity.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                        <p>Represent your legal entities by at least one balancing
                           segment value. You may represent it by two or three balancing segment
                           values if more granular reporting is required. For example, if your
                           legal entity operates in multiple jurisdictions in Europe, you might
                           define balancing segment values and map them to legal reporting units. You
                           can represent a legal entity with more than one balancing segment
                           value. Do not use a single balancing segment value to represent more
                           than one legal entity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In Oracle Fusion General Ledger, there are three
                           balancing segments. You can use separate balancing segments to represent
                           your divisions or strategic business units to enable management reporting
                           at the balance sheet level for each. This solution is used to empower
                           your business unit and divisional managers to track and assume responsibility
                           for their asset utilization or return on investment. Using multiple
                           balancing segments is also useful when you know at the time of implementation
                           that you are disposing of a part of a legal entity and want to isolate
                           the assets and liabilities for that entity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Implementing multiple balancing segments requires
                           every journal entry that is not balanced by division or business unit,
                           to generate balancing lines. You cannot change to multiple balancing
                           segments after you begin using the ledger because your historical
                           data is not balanced by the new balancing segments. Restating historical
                           data must be done at that point. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If your enterprise regularly spins off businesses
                           or holds managers accountable for utilization of assets, identify
                           the business with a balancing segment value. If you account for each
                           legal entity in a separate ledger, no requirement exists to identify
                           the legal entity with a balancing segment value.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>While transactions that cross balancing segments
                           don't necessarily cross legal entity boundaries, all transactions
                           that cross legal entity boundaries must cross balancing segments.
                           If you make an acquisition or are preparing to dispose of a portion
                           of your enterprise, you may want to account for that part of the enterprise
                           in its own balancing segment even if the portion is not a separate
                           legal entity. If you do not map legal entities sharing the same ledger
                           to balancing segments, you cannot distinguish them using intercompany
                           functionality or track individual equity.

                              As the legal employer, you might be required to pay payroll tax, not

                              it must post to a particular ledger. This assignment is required for
                              your business units with business functions that produce financial
                              transactions.

                              mechanism for transactions. For example, if you run your export business
                              separately from your domestic sales business, then secure the export
                              business data to prevent access by the domestic sales employees. To
                              accomplish this security, set up the export business and domestic
                              sales business as two separate business units.

                        types, across business units, or you can have each business unit manage
                        its own set depending on the level at which you want to enforce common
                        policies.

                        <p>A number of Oracle Fusion Applications use business
                           units to implement data security. You assign roles like Accounts Payable
                           Manager to users to permit them to perform specific functions, and
                           you assign business units for each role to users to give them access
                           to data in those business units. For example, users which have been
                           assigned a Payables role for a particular business unit, can perform
                           the function of payables invoicing on the data in that business unit.
                           Roles can be assigned to users manually using the Security Console,
                           or automatically using provisioning rules. Business Units can be assigned
                           to users using the Manage Data Access for Users task in Setup and
                           Maintenance.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Applications reference data sharing
                        feature is also known as SetID. The reference data sharing functionality
                        supports operations in multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses.
                        As a result, there is a reduction in the administrative burden and
                        the time to implement new business units. For example, you can share
                        sales methods, or transaction types across business units. You may
                        also share certain other data across asset books, cost organizations,
                        or project units.

                     <p>The reference data sharing features use reference
                        data sets to which reference data is assigned. The reference data
                        sets group assigned reference data. The sets can be understood as
                        buckets of reference data assigned to multiple business units or other
                        application components.

                        <p>You begin this part of your implementation by creating
                           and assigning reference data to sets. Make changes carefully as changes
                           to a particular set affect all business units or application components
                           using that set. You can assign a separate set to each business unit
                           for the type of object that is being shared. For example, assign separate
                           sets for payment terms, transaction types, and sales methods to your
                           business units.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Your enterprise can determine that certain aspects
                           of your corporate policy can affect all business units. The remaining
                           aspects are at the discretion of the business unit manager to implement.
                           This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each
                           business unit. For example, your enterprise holds business unit managers
                           accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital
                           requirements at a corporate level. In such a case, you can let managers
                           define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally.
                           In this example:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>

                              <p>Each business unit has its own
                                 reference data set for sales methods.
                              </p>

                                 for payment terms is assigned to all business units.

                        <p>The reference data sharing is especially valuable
                           for lowering the cost of setting up new business units. For example,
                           your enterprise operates in the hospitality industry. You are adding
                           a new business unit to track your new spa services. The hospitality
                           divisional reference data set can be assigned to the new business
                           unit to quickly set up data for this entity component. You can establish
                           other business unit reference data in a business unit-specific reference
                           data set as needed.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Reference Data Sharing Methods</h4>
                        
                        <p>Variations exist in the methods used to share data
                           in reference data sets across different types of objects. The following
                           list identifies the methods:
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to one set only, no common
                                 values allowed. This method is the simplest form of sharing reference
                                 data that allows assigning a reference data object instance to one
                                 and only one set. For example, Asset Prorate Conventions are defined
                                 and assigned to only one reference data set. This set can be shared
                                 across multiple asset books, but all the values are contained only
                                 in this one set.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to one set only, with common
                                 values. This method is the most commonly used method of sharing reference
                                 data that allows defining reference data object instance across all
                                 sets. For example, Receivables Transaction Types are assigned to a
                                 common set that is available to all the business units. You need not
                                 explicitly assign the transaction types to each business unit. In
                                 addition, you can assign a business unit-specific set of transaction
                                 types. At transaction entry, the list of values for transaction types
                                 includes the following:
                              </p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Transaction types from the set
                                       assigned to the business unit.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Transaction types assigned to the
                                       common set that is shared across all business units.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                              </ul>
                              
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to multiple sets, no common
                                 values allowed. The method of sharing reference data that allows a
                                 reference data object instance to be assigned to multiple sets. For
                                 instance, Payables Payment Terms use this method. It means that each
                                 payment term can be assigned to one or more than one set. For example,
                                 you assign the payment term Net 30 to several sets, but assign Net
                                 15 to a set specific only to your business unit. At transaction entry,
                                 the list of values for payment terms consists of only the set that
                                 is assigned to the transaction's business unit.
                              </p>

                     <p>Reference data sharing enables you to group
                        set-enabled reference data such as jobs or grades to share the data
                        across different parts of the organization. Sets also enable you to
                        filter reference data at the transaction level so that only data assigned
                        to certain sets is available to be selected. To filter reference data,
                        Oracle Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), applications use the
                        business unit on the transaction. To set up reference data sharing
                        in Oracle Fusion HCM, you create business units and sets, and then
                        assign the sets to the business units.

                        <p>Some reference data in your organization may be considered
                           global, and should therefore be made available for use within the

                           Set, which is a predefined set. Regardless of the business unit on
                           a transaction, reference data assigned to the Common Set is always
                           available, in addition to the reference data assigned to the set that
                           corresponds to the business unit on the transaction.

                        <p>Because locations, departments, and grades are specific
                           to each business unit, InFusion does not want to share these types
                           of reference data across business units. They create a reference data
                           set for each business unit so that data of those types can be set
                           up separately. Because the jobs in the Sales business function are
                           the same across many locations, InFusion decides to create one additional
                           set called Jobs. They override the set assignment for the Jobs reference
                           data group and assign it to the Jobs set. Based on these requirements,
                           they create the following sets:

                           set and assign the Common Set to any jobs that may be used throughout
                           the entire organization.

                     <p>Positions are typically used by industries that use detailed
                        approval rules, which perform detailed budgeting and maintain headcounts,

                        <p>ABC Corporation has high turnovers. It loses approximately
                           5% of its cashiers monthly. The job of the cashier includes three
                           positions: front line cashier, service desk cashier, and layaway cashier.
                           Each job is cross-trained to take over another cashier's position.
                           When one cashier leaves from any of the positions, another existing
                           cashier from the front line, service desk or layaway can assist where
                           needed. But to ensure short lines and customer satisfaction, ABC Corporation
                           must replace each cashier lost to turnover. Since turnover is high
                           in retail it's better for this industry to use positions.

                                 direct reports.

                           Fixed roles tend to endure over time, surviving multiple incumbents.

                           continue to exist after individuals leave, typically model the workforce
                           using positions.

                        provide further detail to make jobs and positions more specific. You
                        also use attributes to define the structure of your jobs and positions.
                        You can specify attributes at the enterprise level for jobs and positions,
                        at the business unit level for positions, and at the reference data
                        set level for jobs. Job and position structures are optional.

                           identify additional details about the job, such as the nature of the
                           work that is performed or the relative skill level required. If these

                        <p>Position attributes at the enterprise level are similar
                           to those for jobs. Each position that you define identifies a specific
                           role in the enterprise, which you can manage independently of the
                           person in the position. A position belongs to one specific department
                           or organization. The name of each position must be unique. To simplify
                           the process of managing unique names for positions, set up enterprise-level
                           attributes to identify separate components of the position name. For
                           example, you can set up an attribute for position title and one for
                           position number. When defining the attributes that make up the structure
                           of a position name, consider whether any of your attributes are part
                           of the definition of a common job type. Using job types for a position
                           can help you manage common information that applies to many different
                           positions. For example you can define a job type of Manager.Level
                           1 and use this for comparison of positions across departments or lines
                           or business, or for setting common job requirements. You can then
                           define multiple manager type positions in your HR department, each
                           of which has responsibility for a different management function or
                           group.

                           you create jobs, these attributes appear in addition to any enterprise-level
                           attributes. For example, you may want to identify all information
                           technology (IT) jobs within a specific set. You can set up a text
                           attribute called Function and use it to enter IT in jobs that you
                           create that perform an IT function within a specific set.

                           an interview-based tool that guides you through setting up divisions,
                           legal entities, business units, and reference data sets. If you do
                           not use the Enterprise Structures Configurator, then you must set
                           up your enterprise structure using the individual tasks that correspond
                           to each enterprise component. In addition, you can't set up multiple
                           configurations and compare different scenarios. Using the Enterprise

                     <p>Reference data sharing facilitates sharing of configuration
                        data such as jobs and payment terms, across organizational divisions
                        or business units. You define reference data sets and determine how
                        common data is shared or partitioned across business entities to avoid
                        duplication and reduce maintenance effort. Depending on the requirement
                        (specific or common), each business unit can maintain its data at
                        a central location, using a set of values either specific to it or
                        shared by other business units.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A common reference data set is available as the default
                        set, which can be assigned to several business units sharing the same
                        reference data. For commonly used data such as currencies, you can
                        use the common reference data set and assign it to multiple business
                        units in various countries that use the same currency. In cases where
                        the default set can't be assigned to an entity, you can create specific
                        sets. The data set visible on the transactional page depends on the
                        sharing method used to share reference data.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, XYZ Corporation uses the same grades
                        throughout the entire organization. Instead of different business
                        units setting up and using the same grades, XYZ Corporation decides
                        to create a set called Grades, which contains the grades. All business
                        units in the organization have the Grades set so that the grades can
                        be shared and used.

                     <p>Reference data sets are logical groups of
                        reference data that various transactional entities can use depending
                        on the business context. You can get started using either the common
                        reference data set or the enterprise set depending on your implementation
                        requirement. You can also create and maintain custom reference data
                        sets, while continuing to use the common reference data set.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Consider the following scenario. Your enterprise
                        can decide that only some aspects of corporate policy should affect
                        all business units. The remaining aspects are at the discretion of
                        the business unit manager to implement. This enables your enterprise
                        to balance autonomy and control for each business unit. For example,
                        your enterprise holds business unit managers accountable for their
                        profit and loss, but manages working capital requirements at a corporate
                        level. Then, you can let managers define their own sales methods,
                        but define payment terms centrally. As a result, each business unit
                        has its own reference data set for sales methods and one central reference
                        data set for payment terms assigned to all business units.

                           common sets or subsets to enable sharing reference data between several

                     <h3>Reference Data Sets and Sharing Methods: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Oracle Fusion Applications reference data sharing
                        feature is also known as SetID. The reference data sharing functionality
                        supports operations in multiple ledgers, business units, and warehouses.
                        As a result, there is a reduction in the administrative burden and
                        the time to implement new business units. For example, you can share
                        sales methods, or transaction types across business units. You may
                        also share certain other data across asset books, cost organizations,
                        or project units.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The reference data sharing features use reference
                        data sets to which reference data is assigned. The reference data
                        sets group assigned reference data. The sets can be understood as
                        buckets of reference data assigned to multiple business units or other
                        application components.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <div class="sect3" id="FAFCF94313">
                        <h4 class="topictitle">Reference Data Sets</h4>
                        
                        <p>You begin this part of your implementation by creating
                           and assigning reference data to sets. Make changes carefully as changes
                           to a particular set affect all business units or application components
                           using that set. You can assign a separate set to each business unit
                           for the type of object that is being shared. For example, assign separate
                           sets for payment terms, transaction types, and sales methods to your
                           business units.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Your enterprise can determine that certain aspects
                           of your corporate policy can affect all business units. The remaining
                           aspects are at the discretion of the business unit manager to implement.
                           This allows your enterprise to balance autonomy and control for each
                           business unit. For example, your enterprise holds business unit managers
                           accountable for their profit and loss, but manages working capital
                           requirements at a corporate level. In such a case, you can let managers
                           define their own sales methods, but define payment terms centrally.
                           In this example:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Each business unit has its own
                                 reference data set for sales methods.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>One central reference data set
                                 for payment terms is assigned to all business units.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The reference data sharing is especially valuable
                           for lowering the cost of setting up new business units. For example,
                           your enterprise operates in the hospitality industry. You are adding
                           a new business unit to track your new spa services. The hospitality
                           divisional reference data set can be assigned to the new business
                           unit to quickly set up data for this entity component. You can establish
                           other business unit reference data in a business unit-specific reference
                           data set as needed.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                     </div>

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Reference Data Sharing Methods</h4>
                        
                        <p>Variations exist in the methods used to share data
                           in reference data sets across different types of objects. The following
                           list identifies the methods:
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to one set only, no common
                                 values allowed. This method is the simplest form of sharing reference
                                 data that allows assigning a reference data object instance to one
                                 and only one set. For example, Asset Prorate Conventions are defined
                                 and assigned to only one reference data set. This set can be shared
                                 across multiple asset books, but all the values are contained only
                                 in this one set.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to one set only, with common
                                 values. This method is the most commonly used method of sharing reference
                                 data that allows defining reference data object instance across all
                                 sets. For example, Receivables Transaction Types are assigned to a
                                 common set that is available to all the business units. You need not
                                 explicitly assign the transaction types to each business unit. In
                                 addition, you can assign a business unit-specific set of transaction
                                 types. At transaction entry, the list of values for transaction types
                                 includes the following:
                              </p>
                              
                              <ul>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Transaction types from the set
                                       assigned to the business unit.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                                 <li>
                                    <p>Transaction types assigned to the
                                       common set that is shared across all business units.
                                    </p>
                                 </li>
                                 
                              </ul>
                              
                           </li>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Assignment to multiple sets, no common
                                 values allowed. The method of sharing reference data that allows a
                                 reference data object instance to be assigned to multiple sets. For
                                 instance, Payables Payment Terms use this method. It means that each
                                 payment term can be assigned to one or more than one set. For example,
                                 you assign the payment term Net 30 to several sets, but assign Net
                                 15 to a set specific only to your business unit. At transaction entry,
                                 the list of values for payment terms consists of only the set that
                                 is assigned to the transaction's business unit.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                        reference data sets into groups and assign them to the reference entity
                        objects. The assignment takes into consideration the determinant type,

                        <p>If you share your items across warehouses or manufacturing
                           facilities, you can access them through a common item master. Configure
                           one or multiple item masters for your enterprise, based your enterprise
                           structure. A single item master is recommended because it provides
                           simpler and more efficient maintenance. However, in rare cases, it
                           may be beneficial to keep multiple item masters. For example, if you
                           acquire another enterprise and want to continue to operate your lines
                           of business separately, maintaining a second item master might be
                           the best decision.

                           plastics and dyes from the same supplier, but from different local
                           supplier sites to save transportation costs.

                           within the context of an enterprise that has already been created
                           in the application for you. This is either a predefined enterprise

                           administrator. An enterprise organization captures the name of the
                           deploying enterprise and the location of the headquarters. In Oracle
                           Fusion Applications, an organization classified as an enterprise is
                           defined before defining any other organizations in the HCM Common
                           Organization Model. All other organizations are defined as belonging

                     <p>A location identifies physical addresses of
                        a workforce structure, such as a department or a job. You create and
                        manage locations using the Manage Locations task in the Workforce
                        Structures work area. 
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also create locations to enter the addresses
                        of external organizations that you want to maintain, such as employment
                        agencies, tax authorities, and insurance or benefits carriers.
                     </p>
                     <p>The locations that you create exist as separate structures
                        that you can use for reporting purposes, and in rules that determine
                        employee eligibility for various types of compensation and benefits.
                        You enter information about a location only once. Subsequently, when
                        you set up other workforce structures you select the location from
                        a list.

                        <p>When you create a location, you must associate it
                           with a set. Only those
                           users who have access to the set's business unit can access the location
                           set and other associated workforce structure sets, such as those that
                           contain departments and jobs.

                           <li>
                              <p>You can also associate the location
                                 to the common set so that users across your enterprise can access
                                 the location irrespective of their business unit.

                                 they can see the locations that they have access to along with the
                                 locations in the common set.

                     <h3>Geography Structure, Hierarchy, and Validation: How They Fit Together</h3>
                     <p>There are three components that are dependent
                        on each other when defining a country: geography structure, geography
                        hierarchy, and geography validation. Every country has to have the
                        geography structure defined first before the hierarchy can be defined,
                        and the geography hierarchy has to be defined before the validation
                        can be defined.
                     </p>
                     <div class="sect3" id="FAFCF299538"><h4 class="topictitle">Geography Structure</h4>
                        <p> Firstly, you need to create a geography structure
                           for each country to define which geography types are part of the country
                           structure, and how the geography types are hierarchically related
                           within the country structure. For example, you can create geography
                           types called State, City, and Postal Code. Then you can rank the State
                           geography type as the highest level within the country, the City as
                           the second level, and the Postal Code as the lowest level within the
                           country structure. Geography structure can be defined using the <span class="uicontrol">Manage Geographies </span>task, or can be imported
                           using tasks in the <span class="uicontrol">Define Geographies </span>activity.
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="sect3" id="FAFCF300006"><h4 class="topictitle">Geography Hierarchy</h4>
                        <p>Once the geography structure is defined, the geographies
                           for each geography type can be added to the hierarchy. For example,
                           below the United States you can create a geography called California
                           using a State geography type.
                        </p>
                        <p>As part of managing the geography hierarchy you can
                           view, create, edit, and delete the geographies for each geography
                           type in the country structure. You can also add a primary and alternate
                           name and code for each geography. A geography hierarchy can be created
                           using the <span class="uicontrol">Manage Geographies </span>task,
                           or can be imported using tasks in the <span class="uicontrol">Define
                              Geographies </span>activity.
                        </p>

                     <div class="sect3" id="FAFCF300007"><h4 class="topictitle">Geography Validation</h4>
                        <p>After defining the geography hierarchy, you need to
                           specify the geography validations for the country. You can choose
                           which address style formats you would like to use for the country,
                           and for each selected address style format you can map geography types
                           to address attributes. You can also select which geography types should
                           be included in geography or tax validation, and which geography types
                           will display in a list of values during address entry in other user
                           interfaces. The geography validation level for the country, such as
                           error or warning, can also be selected.

                        <p>You can determine how a country's geographies
                           are hierarchically related by creating the hierarchy of the geography
                           types in the geography structure. When you define a country's structure,
                           the geography type Country is implicitly at the top of the geography
                           structure with the level 1. The subsequent geography types that you
                           add after country are numbered in sequence.

                        <p>You must add a geography type as a level in the country
                           structure before you can define a geography for that geography type
                           in a country. For example, before defining the state of California,
                           the State geography type must be added to the United States country
                           structure. To quickly create country structure, you can copy a structure
                           from another country and modify the geography types for the country.

                     <p>This topic describes geography hierarchy and
                        various aspects of geography hierarchy.
                     </p>
                     <p>Geography hierarchy is a data model that creates
                        conceptual parent-child relationships between geographies. The top
                        level of the geography hierarchy is country, which is the parent,
                        and the hierarchy contains several child geographies. The following
                        table shows sample parent-child relationships in a geography.

                        By defining the mapping and validation for this format you will ensure
                        that validations can be performed for any address in the country.
                        After the <span class="uicontrol">No Styles Format</span> is
                        defined you can set up additional mapping for specific address styles.

                        <p>For every address style format, you can map
                           each geography type to an address attribute. For example, you can

                           appear are based on how the country structure is defined. The list
                           of address attributes that appear are based on address formats delivered
                           with the application, or your customer defined address formats.

                        <p>Once a geography type is mapped to an attribute,
                           then you can specify whether the geography type will appear in a list
                           of values during address entry in user interfaces. It is very important
                           to review carefully if you want to enable a list of values. You should
                           only enable a list of values if you have sufficient geography data
                           imported or created for that geography. If the setup for master geography
                           data is incomplete, then the geography  data is either not imported
                           or created. As a result, the list of values for the address attribute
                           does not list any geography data.

                           attribute, you can only select the geography data available for the
                           geography type. This means that if a specific geography value is not
                           available in the geography hierarchy, you cannot create an address
                           with a different geography value.

                        <p>You can also specify whether a geography type
                           will be included in tax validation. For example, for the United States
                           North America address style format you specify that County, State,
                           and City are used for tax validation. This will mean that when a transaction
                           involves an address with the North America address style, the address

                           be included in geography validation. This will mean that, for example,
                           when the user enters a United States address using the North America
                           address style format, the address must have the correct country, state,
                           and postal code combination based on geography hierarchy data to be
                           considered geographically valid.

                           but not selected for geography validation usage, then during address
                           entry suggested values will be provided for the address element, but

                           For either the tax or geography validation, do not
                           skip more than one consecutive level unless you are certain that the
                           selected geography types can uniquely identify geographies. For example,
                           the United States country structure is: State, County, City, and Postal
                           Code, and you want to select just State and Postal Code for geography
                           or tax validation. However, for the combination of California and
                           94065, the city can be either Redwood Shores or Redwood City. In this
                           case, you should also select at least the City geography type for
                           geography or tax validation.

                           did not pass validation during address entry. For example, if the

                     <p>This topic explains geocoding and how to
                        enable this option in the application.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Geocoding is the process of finding latitude and
                        longitude coordinates from geographic data such as street addresses
                        or zip codes. Once these coordinates are available, you can use the
                        spatial services feature to identify points of interest, such as customer
                        and contact addresses, in the vicinity. The application integrates
                        the Geocoding feature with eLocation (http://elocation.oracle.com/maps_oracle_dot_com_main.html),
                        which is a Geocoding service provided by Oracle.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>By default, the Geocoding option is turned off in
                        the application. You can enable the Geocoding option in the <span class="uicontrol">Setup and Maintenance, Manage Geographies</span> page. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the Geocoding feature is enabled, the feature
                        can be scheduled to run at regular time intervals. This ensures that
                        newly created or updated locations are picked up and geocoded whenever
                        you create or update an address using the user interface, web services,
                        bulk import, or file-based import.

                     <p>A geography, such as Tokyo or Peru, describes
                        a boundary on the surface of the earth. You can create new geographies
                        by importing data through interface tables. There are
                        two options for populating the interface tables: using the tool of
                        your preference to load the data or using file-based data import.
                        If you plan to provide the data details in a source file, use the
                        file-based import feature. If you will populate the interface table
                        directly, run the geography loader process to import the data. Having
                        a good understanding of the import entity, interface table, and destination
                        table will help you prepare your import data.

                           entity and interface table that forms the geography. If you are using
                           file-based import, you can map your source file data to import entity
                           attributes that correspond to the interface table columns. The import
                           activity process populates the interface table based on the mapping
                           and your source file. If using the geography loader scheduled process,
                           populate the interface table directly using your preferred tool. If

                        data for the countries where you do business. Using the Nokia geography
                        reference data, you no longer have to source geography data from a third
                        party. You can import Oracle-licensed Nokia data from NAVTEQ, including
                        the country structure and hierarchy information, either to create
                        a new geography setup or replace your existing geography data.

                           the territory definitions that are based on the Geography dimension.
                           You can either export the definitions of all territories to a file
                           or make manual corrections. If there are a large number of territories,
                           export the territories definition to a file that can be used during
                           the territories import process. However, if there are very few affected
                           territories, then you can choose to either export the territories
                           definition to a file or make corrections manually.

                           you must create a support request with proper justification. Note
                           that when the master geography data is deleted, the geography and
                           its children are deleted and all the related territory, tax, and shipping
                           zone references become invalid. So you must take backup of these before
                           deleting the master geography data.

                              must perform Step 5 to 10.

                     <p>This topic explains how to prepare and import
                        geography data from an external data source using the File-Based Data
                        Import feature. A geography is any region with a boundary around it,
                        regardless of its size. It might be a state, a country, a city, a
                        county, or a ward. You must create or import geographies before you
                        can associate them with custom zones and addresses.
                     </p>

                        The application ships with third-party (Nokia) master
                        geography data for multiple countries that can be easily imported.
                        You can import Oracle-licensed Nokia data from Navteq, for those countries
                        where the data is available, such as the U.S. You can import Nokia
                        Geography data using the Manage Geographies task. Search for the country,
                        and select Import Nokia Data from the Actions menu. If the licensed
                        Navteq data is not available for a particular country, then the Import
                        Nokia Data action is disabled. For more information, see Replacing
                        Existing Master Geography Data with Revised Nokia Geography Data:
                        Procedure.
                        
                        <p>If Nokia geography data is not available for a country,
                           then use the information in this chapter to import it using File-Based

                        <p>You must understand how your geography data
                           corresponds with the data in the application so that you can map your

                           must understand how the application represents the structure of the
                           data for a geography.

                           in a hierarchy using geography level numbers. For example, if you
                           are importing the country structure of Australia, the country structure
                           could be the following: 1: Country, 2: State, 3: County, 4: Town,

                           incorporates the structure of the geography into import objects. The

                           objects so that you can prepare your import data. You can use reference
                           guide files that contain attribute descriptions, values that populate
                           attributes by default when you do not provide values, and validation
                           information for each import object attribute. The validation information
                           includes the navigation path to the task where you can define values
                           in the application. For example, if you have values in your data that
                           correlate to a choice list in the application, then the validation
                           information for that attribute provides the task name in the Setup
                           and Maintenance work area where you can define your values. For additional
                           information, including a list of reference guide file names and locations
                           that you need to complete this task, see the following table.

                           the interface tables according to your mapping, and imports the data
                           into the application destination tables.

                           activities. You submit file-based import activities for each import

                        <p>You can use the Geography import object to import
                           geography hierarchy information to create or update the geography
                           data of a country. To map the source data in your import file to the
                           target attributes in the application, you must understand how the
                           target objects are related and what attributes are included in each
                           target object.

                        <p>The target import objects in the Geography import
                           object contain information about the geography hierarchy. When updating
                           an existing geography, you must provide the parent reference information
                           of the existing geography, which connects the geography to the country
                           of which it is a part.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Use the ImpGeography target import object to create

                           Before you import geography data for a country, you

                        <p>You must compare the attributes that you want to import
                           with the target object attributes that are available and with their
                           valid values. To evaluate your source data and Oracle Sales Cloud
                           attributes for mapping and validation, you use a reference file. 
                           See the File Based Data Import for Oracle Sales Cloud guide available
                           on the Oracle Sales Cloud Help Center (https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/salescs_gs/docs.htm).
                           In the File Based Data Imports chapter, see the topic for your import
                           object of interest, which includes links to reference files for target
                           import objects. A reference guide file includes attribute descriptions,
                           default values, and validations performed by the import process. Review
                           the validation for each attribute to determine whether there are functional
                           prerequisites or prerequisite setup tasks that are required.

                        <p>To import your source file data, you define a mapping
                           between your source file data and the combination of the target object
                           and target object attribute. You can predefine and manage import mappings
                           using the Manage File Import Mappings task, or you can define the
                           mapping when you define the import activity using the Manage File
                           Import Activities task. Both tasks are available in the Setup and
                           Maintenance work area.

                        the application so that the geography data can be used for real time
                        address validation and tax purposes.

                              Parent Source ID values is unique for each row of data within a single
                              import. However, your source data files don't need to have the same
                              Source ID and Parent Source ID values as your previously imported
                              geography data. If the geography structure levels and the parents
                              for each geography value are the same, then the changed IDs will not
                              affect the import.

                              are included in your data file so that the child geography can be
                              added. For example, if you originally imported US, CA, and San Francisco,
                              and now you want to import the city of San Jose in CA, then your data
                              file must include US, CA, and San Jose.

                           <p>Check that your source data file has the correct
                              values for the geography data that you have already loaded. For example,
                              if your initial import included the value US for country and CA as
                              state, and in a subsequent import you have California as a state,
                              then your geography import creates two state records (CA and California)
                              in the application data, with the US as the country parent.

                     <p>This topic explains how to prepare and import
                        country structure data from an external data source using the File-Based
                        Data Import feature. A country structure is a hierarchical grouping
                        of geography types for a country. For example, the geography structure
                        for the United States has the geography type of State at the top,
                        followed by the County, then the City, and finally the Postal Code.

                        <p>You must understand how your country structure

                           the data for a country structure.

                           in a hierarchy using geography level numbers. For example, if you're

                           could be the following: 1: Country, 2: State, 3: County, 4: Town,
                           5: ZIP.

                        <p>To facilitate importing country structures, the application
                           incorporates the structure of the country structure into import objects.

                           objects so that you can prepare your import data. . You can use reference
                           guide files that contain attribute descriptions, values that populate
                           attributes by default when you don't provide values, and validation
                           information for each attribute. The validation information includes
                           the navigation path to the task where you can define values in the
                           application. For example, if you have values in your data that correlate
                           to a choice list in the application, then the validation information
                           for that attribute provides the task name in the Setup and Maintenance
                           work area where you can define your values. For additional information,
                           including a list of reference guide file names and locations that
                           you need to complete this task, see the following table.

                        <p>The Country Structure import object contains one target
                           import object. The target import object organizes the individual attributes
                           of the different aspects of the geography structure. When updating
                           an existing country structure, you must provide the parent reference
                           information of the existing country structure. This reference information
                           connects the imported geography structure to the existing one. Use
                           the ImpGeoStructureLevel target import object to create and update
                           country structure information.

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Target Import Object Attributes</h4>
                        
                        <p>You must compare the attributes that you want to import
                           with the target object attributes that are available and with their
                           valid values. To evaluate your source data and Oracle Sales Cloud
                           attributes for mapping and validation, you use a reference file. 
                           See the File Based Data Import for Oracle Sales Cloud guide available
                           on the Oracle Sales Cloud Help Center (https://docs.oracle.com/cloud/latest/salescs_gs/docs.htm). In the File Based Data Imports chapter, see the topic for your
                           import object of interest, which includes links to reference files
                           for target import objects. A reference guide file includes attribute
                           descriptions, default values, and validations performed by the import
                           process. Review the validation for each attribute to determine whether
                           there are functional prerequisites or prerequisite setup tasks that
                           are required.

                        <p>To import your source file data, you define a mapping
                           between your source file data and the combination of the target object
                           and target object attribute. You can predefine and manage import mappings
                           using the Manage File Import Mappings task, or you can define the
                           mapping when you define the import activity using the Manage File
                           Import Activities  task.  Both tasks are available in the Setup and
                           Maintenance work area.

                     <p> Territory geography zones are geographical
                        boundaries that you can set up to replicate your organization's regions,
                        such as a Pacific Northwest sales region. You can set up territory
                        geography zones in one application instance, and then after the territory
                        geography zones are defined you can export the territory zones and
                        import them into another application instance.

                        <p>Firstly, you need to import the master reference
                           geography data. Master reference geography data consists of geography
                           elements such as country, state, and city, and is required for any
                           geographical information you store in the application, such as address
                           information used in customer and sales records. For more information,
                           refer to the Geography Hierarchy: Explained topic listed in the related
                           topics section. Master reference geography data can be imported into
                           the application using the Manage File Import Activities task in Setup
                           and Maintenance - refer to the Importing Master Reference Geography

                           and the US allows for companies to register in one state and do business

                        <p>You are required to publish specific and periodic

                           reports must be filed with specified national and regulatory authorities.
                           For example, in the United States (US), your publicly owned entities
                           (corporations) are required to file quarterly and annual reports,
                           as well as other periodic reports, with the Securities and Exchange
                           Commission (SEC), which enforces statutory reporting requirements

                        <p>Individual entities privately held or held by public
                           companies do not have to file separately. In other countries, your
                           individual entities do have to file in their own name, as well as
                           at the public group level. Disclosure requirements are diverse. For
                           example, your local entities may have to file locally to comply with
                           local regulations in a local currency, as well as being included in
                           your enterprise's reporting requirements in different currency.

                        <p>A legal entity can represent all or part of your
                           enterprise's management framework. For example, if you operate in
                           a large country such as the United Kingdom or Germany, you might incorporate
                           each division in the country as a separate legal entity. In a smaller
                           country, for example Austria, you might use a single legal entity

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Applications support the modeling
                        of your legal entities. If you make purchases from or sell to other legal entities, define
                        these other legal entities in your customer and supplier registers.
                        These registers are part of the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Architecture.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When your legal entities are trading with each other,
                        represent them as legal entities and as customers and suppliers in
                        your customer and supplier registers. Use legal entity relationships
                        to determine which transactions are intercompany and require intercompany
                        accounting. Your legal entities can be identified as legal employers
                        and therefore, are available for use in Human Capital Management (HCM)
                        applications.

                        <p>All of the assets of the enterprise are owned

                           users to enter legal entities on transactions that represent a movement
                           in value or obligation.

                        <p>For example, a sales order creates an obligation
                           on the legal entity that books the order to deliver the goods on the
                           acknowledged date. The creation also creates an obligation on the
                           purchaser to receive and pay for those goods. Under contract law in

                           and revaluation reserves must be reflected in your legal entity's
                           accounts. In Oracle Fusion Applications, your inventory within an

                        <p>A business unit  can process transactions on behalf of many

                           entity. In most cases, the legal entity is explicit on your transactions.
                           For example, a payables invoice has an explicit legal entity field.
                           Your accounts payables department can process supplier invoices on
                           behalf of one or many business units.

                        <p>In some cases, your legal entity is inferred from
                           your business unit that is processing the transaction. For example,
                           Business Unit ACM UK has a default legal entity of InFusion UK Ltd.
                           When a purchase order is placed in ACM UK, the legal entity InFusion
                           UK Ltd is legally obligated to the supplier. Oracle Fusion Procurement,
                           Oracle Fusion Project Portfolio Management, and Oracle Fusion Supply
                           Chain applications rely on deriving the legal entity information from

                           can represent a legal entity with more than one balancing segment
                           value. Do not use a single balancing segment value to represent more
                           than one legal entity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In Oracle Fusion General Ledger, there are three
                           balancing segments. You can use separate balancing segments to represent
                           your divisions or strategic business units to enable management reporting
                           at the balance sheet level for each. This solution is used to empower
                           your business unit and divisional managers to track and assume responsibility
                           for their asset utilization or return on investment. Using multiple
                           balancing segments is also useful when you know at the time of implementation
                           that you are disposing of a part of a legal entity and want to isolate
                           the assets and liabilities for that entity.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Implementing multiple balancing segments requires
                           every journal entry that is not balanced by division or business unit,
                           to generate balancing lines. You cannot change to multiple balancing
                           segments after you begin using the ledger because your historical
                           data is not balanced by the new balancing segments. Restating historical
                           data must be done at that point. 
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If your enterprise regularly spins off businesses
                           or holds managers accountable for utilization of assets, identify
                           the business with a balancing segment value. If you account for each
                           legal entity in a separate ledger, no requirement exists to identify
                           the legal entity with a balancing segment value.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>While transactions that cross balancing segments
                           don't necessarily cross legal entity boundaries, all transactions
                           that cross legal entity boundaries must cross balancing segments.
                           If you make an acquisition or are preparing to dispose of a portion
                           of your enterprise, you may want to account for that part of the enterprise
                           in its own balancing segment even if the portion is not a separate
                           legal entity. If you do not map legal entities sharing the same ledger
                           to balancing segments, you cannot distinguish them using intercompany
                           functionality or track individual equity.

                     <p>When you set up legal entities, you can identify
                        them as legal employers and payroll
                        statutory units, which makes them available for use in Oracle
                        Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM). Depending on how your organization
                        is structured, you may have only one legal entity that is also a payroll
                        statutory unit and a legal employer, or you may have multiple legal
                        entities, payroll statutory units, and legal employers.

                        <p>Payroll statutory units enable you to group legal
                           employers so that you can perform statutory calculations at a higher
                           level, such as for court orders or for United Kingdom (UK) statutory
                           sick pay. In some cases, a legal employer is also a payroll statutory
                           unit. However, your organization may have several legal employers
                           under one payroll statutory unit. A legal employer can belong to only
                           one payroll statutory unit.

                        <p>Payroll statutory units and tax reporting units have
                           a parent-child relationship, with the payroll statutory unit being

                        <p>Tax reporting units are indirectly associated with
                           a legal employer through the payroll statutory unit. One or more tax
                           reporting units can be used by a single legal employer, and a tax
                           reporting unit can be used by one or more legal employers.  For example,
                           assume that a single tax reporting unit is linked to a payroll statutory
                           unit. Assume also that two legal employers are associated with this
                           payroll statutory unit. In this example, both legal employers are
                           associated with the single tax reporting unit.

                        <p>Use the Manage Legal Reporting Unit HCM Information

                           unit. If you create a new legal reporting unit that belongs to a legal
                           employer (that is not also a payroll statutory unit), you select a
                           parent payroll statutory unit and then, when you run the Manage Legal
                           Reporting Unit HCM Information task, you designate it as a tax reporting

                        <p>Payroll statutory units are legal entities that are

                           and social insurance. A payroll statutory unit can pay and report
                           on payroll tax and social insurance on behalf of one or many legal
                           entities, depending on the structure of your enterprise. For example,
                           if you are a multinational, multiple company enterprise, then you
                           register a payroll statutory unit in each country where you employ
                           and pay people. You can optionally register a consolidated payroll
                           statutory unit to pay and report on workers across multiple legal employers within
                           the same country. You associate a legislative data group with a payroll statutory unit to provide the correct payroll information
                           for workers.

                     <p>A tax profile is the body of information that
                        relates to a party's transaction tax activities. A tax profile can
                        include main and default information, tax registration, tax exemptions,
                        party fiscal classifications, tax reporting codes, configuration options,
                        and service subscriptions.

                        <p>Set up tax profiles for your first-party legal entities,
                           legal reporting units, and business units.

                        <p>First-party legal entities identify your organization
                           to the relevant legal authorities, for example, a national or international
                           headquarters. Legal entities let you model your external relationships
                           to legal authorities more accurately. The relationships between first-party
                           legal entities and the relevant tax authorities normally control the
                           setup of the transaction taxes required by your business. Under most
                           circumstances, the tax setup is used and maintained based on the configuration
                           of the legal entity. Enter the default information, party fiscal classifications,
                           tax reporting codes, and configuration options for your legal entities.
                           You can also specify if you're using the tax services of an external
                           service provider for tax calculation.
                        </p>

                           with a tax requirement. A legal reporting unit tax profile is automatically
                           created for the headquarter legal entity. Set up additional legal
                           reporting unit tax profiles for those needed for tax purposes. For
                           legal reporting units, enter the default information, tax registrations,
                           party fiscal classifications, and tax reporting codes. Also, define
                           tax reporting details for your VAT and global tax reporting needs
                           for tax registrations of tax regimes that allow this setup.

                           To help you manage the tax needs of your business units, you can use
                           the business unit tax profile in either of two ways:

                                 legal entity at transaction time. The tax setup of the associated
                                 legal entity setup is either specific to the legal entity or shared
                                 across legal entities using the Global Configuration Owner setup.

                                 for the business unit to indicate that the subscribed tax content
                                 is used for the transactions created for the business unit.

                     <p>Each of your legal entities has at least one legal reporting unit. Legal reporting units can also be referred to as establishments.
                        You can define either domestic or foreign establishments. Define legal
                        reporting units by physical location, such as sales offices, or by
                        logical unit, such as groups of employees subject to different reporting
                        requirements. For example, define logical legal reporting units for
                        both salaried and hourly paid employees.

                     <p>Another example of logical reporting units is in Oracle
                        Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM) where you use legal reporting
                        units to model tax reporting units. A tax reporting unit is used to
                        group workers for the purpose of tax reporting.

                        <p>Plan and define your legal reporting units at both
                           the local and national levels if you operate within the administrative
                           boundaries of a jurisdiction that is more granular than country. 
                           For example, your legal entity establishes operations in a country
                           that requires reporting of employment and sales taxes locally as well
                           as nationally. Therefore, you need more than one legally registered
                           location to meet this legal entity's reporting requirements in each
                           local area. Additionally, legal entities in Europe operate across
                           national boundaries, and require you to set up legal reporting units
                           for the purposes of local registration in each country. There can be multiple registrations
                           associated with a legal reporting unit. However, only one identifying
                           registration can be defined by the legal authority used for the legal
                           entity or legal reporting unit and associated with the legal reporting
                           unit.

                     <p>A business unit is a unit of an enterprise
                        that performs one or many business functions that can
                        be rolled up in a management hierarchy. A business unit can process
                        transactions on behalf of many legal entities. Normally, it has
                        a manager, strategic objectives, a level of autonomy, and responsibility
                        for its profit and loss. Roll business units up into divisions if you structure your chart of accounts with this type of hierarchy.

                        <li>
                           <p>Assign your business units to one primary ledger. For
                              example, if a business unit is processing payables invoices, then
                              it must post to a particular ledger. This assignment is required for
                              your business units with business functions that produce financial
                              transactions.

                              business data to prevent access by the domestic sales employees. To
                              accomplish this security, set up the export business and domestic
                              sales business as two separate business units.

                        types, across business units, or you can have each business unit manage
                        its own set depending on the level at which you want to enforce common

                        <p>A number of Oracle Fusion Applications use business
                           units to implement data security. You assign roles like Accounts Payable
                           Manager to users to permit them to perform specific functions, and
                           you assign business units for each role to users to give them access
                           to data in those business units. For example, users which have been
                           assigned a Payables role for a particular business unit, can perform
                           the function of payables invoicing on the data in that business unit.
                           Roles can be assigned to users manually using the Security Console,
                           or automatically using provisioning rules. Business Units can be assigned
                           to users using the Manage Data Access for Users task in Setup and
                           Maintenance.

                           Fusion Applications, a business function logically indicates a presence
                           of a department in the business unit with people performing tasks
                           associated with these business functions. A business unit can have
                           many departments performing various business functions. Optionally,
                           you can define a hierarchy of divisions, business units, and departments as a tree over
                           HCM organization units to represent your enterprise structure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                           This hierarchy definition is not required in the setup
                           of your applications, but is a recommended best practice.
                           
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>Your enterprise procedures can require a manager of
                           a business unit to have responsibility for their profit and loss statement.
                           In such cases, any segment that allows the identification of associated
                           revenue and costs can be used as a profit center identification. 
                           The segment can be qualified as a cost center segment.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>However, there are cases where a business unit is
                           performing only general and administrative functions, in which case
                           your manager's financial goals are limited to cost containment or
                           recovering of service costs. For example, if a shared service center
                           at the corporate office provides services for more commercially-oriented
                           business units, it does not show a profit and therefore, only tracks
                           its costs.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>In other cases, where your managers have a responsibility
                           for the assets of the business unit, a balance sheet can be produced.
                           The recommended best practice to produce a balance sheet is to setup
                           the business unit as a balancing segment in the chart of accounts.
                           The business unit balancing segment can roll up to divisions or other
                           entities to represent your enterprise structure.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>When a business function produces financial transactions,
                           a business unit must be assigned to a primary ledger, and a default legal entity. Each
                           business unit can post transactions to a single primary ledger, but
                           it can process transactions for many legal entities.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The following business functions generate financial
                           transactions and will require a primary ledger and a default legal
                           entity:

                           segments. Hierarchies created using the management segment
                           can provide the divisional results. For example, it is possible to
                           define management segment values to correspond to business units,
                           and arrange them in a hierarchy where the higher nodes correspond
                           to divisions and subdivisions, as in the Infusion US Division example
                           above.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion applications supports shared
                        service centers in two ways. First, with business unit security, which
                        allows your shared service centers personnel to process transactions
                        for other business
                        units called clients. This was the foundation of Multi Org
                        Access Control in the Oracle E-Business Suite.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Second, the service provider model expands
                        on this capability to allow a business unit and its personnel in a
                        shared service center to work on transactions of the client business
                        units. It is possible to view the clients of a service provider business
                        unit, and to view service providers of a client business unit.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Your shared service centers provide services to your
                        client business units that can be part of other legal entities. In such cases, your
                        cross charges and recoveries are in the form of receivables invoices,
                        and not merely allocations within your general ledger, thereby providing
                        internal controls and preventing inappropriate processing.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, in traditional local operations, an invoice
                        of one business unit cannot be paid by a payment from another business
                        unit. In contrast, in your shared service center environment, processes
                        allowing one business unit to perform services for others, such as
                        paying an invoice, are allowed and completed with the appropriate
                        intercompany accounting.  Shared service centers provide your users
                        with access to the data of different business units and can comply
                        with different local requirements.
                     </p>

                        <p>The setup of business units provides you with
                           a powerful security construct by creating relationships between the
                           functions your users can perform and the data they can process. This
                           security model is appropriate in a business environment where local
                           business units are solely responsible for managing all aspects of
                           the finance and administration functions.

                        <p>In Oracle Fusion applications, the business functions your business
                           unit performs are evident in the user interface for setting up business
                           units. To accommodate shared services, use business unit security
                           to expand the relationship between functions and data. A user can
                           have access to many business units. This is the core of your shared
                           service architecture.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, you take orders in many businesses. Your
                           orders are segregated by business unit. However, all of these orders
                           are managed from a shared service order desk in an outsourcing environment
                           by your users who have access to multiple business units.

                           areas where shared service centers are generally implemented include
                           procurement, disbursement, collections, order management, and human
                           resources. The advantages of deploying these shared service centers
                           are the following:

                     <p>In Oracle Fusion applications, the service
                        provider model defines relationships between business units for a specific business function, identifying one business in the relationship as a service provider
                        of the business function, and the other business unit as its client. 
                     </p>

                           the procurement business function. Define your business units with

                           business unit responsible for the procurement business function takes
                           care of supplier negotiations, supplier site maintenance, and purchase
                           order processing on behalf of your client business units. Subscribe
