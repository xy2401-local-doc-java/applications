                  <h2>Itemizing a Hotel Bill: Worked Example</h2>
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>This example demonstrates how an employee
                     creates and itemizes business and personal expenses after returning
                     from a business trip. One expense is shared between two cost centers.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Enterprises typically implement one of the following
                     practices:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Corporate cards are implemented and
                           the corporate card charge feed is imported into the application. Based
                           on setup, card charges come in as a single line. In this case, employees
                           must itemize expenses manually.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>
                        <p>Corporate cards are implemented and
                           the corporate card charge feed is imported into the application. Based
                           on setup, card charges come in as individual items. In this case,
                           an indicator of the itemizations appears in the Expense Items infotile
                           and employees don't have to itemize expenses manually.

                  <p>Business - Employee Paid is a business expense
                     classification where you pay the corporate card provider for corporate
                     card expenses incurred. This expense classification indicates that
                     your company will reimburse you, rather than the corporate card provider.
                     The following scenario illustrates when you might classify business
                     expenses as Business - Employee Paid rather than Business or Personal.

                     In the Both Pay scenario, your employer reimburses the card issuer
                     for corporate card expenses and you pay for personal expenses.

                        before completing her expense report. When Jane completes her expense
                        report, she classifies the expenses as Business - Employee Paid, rather
                        than Business or Personal, because she as already paid the business

                     <p>Expenses enables you to delegate expense entry to
                        another person. For example, as an executive, you can delegate expense

                     <p>Expenses also enables you to enter expense reports
                        for another person. For example, you can enter expense reports for
                        your manager if your manager has authorized you to enter reports on
                        his or her behalf. You can view the persons who have authorized you

                     <p>To create an expense report for another person, you
                        access Expenses by using your own user name and password and then,
                        in the Expenses work area, you select the name of the person for whom

                        match between a mobile device expense and a card expense, it automatically
                        merges the two lines into one. The web-based application alerts you
                        to a match by displaying a <span class="uicontrol">Match</span> icon, which displays as double pages, on the merged line.

                        web-based application isn't a match, click the <span class="uicontrol">Delete</span> icon. Both the mobile device expense and the corporate

                        device expense versus multiple corporate card expenses. The icon displays
                        as a red exclamation point on the single expense. For example, if

                        expenses, the web-based application displays the <span class="uicontrol">Potential Match</span> on the card expense.

                        or Business

                        You can prevent this automatic population by creating the profile
                        option, EXM_DFLT_FROM_PREV_EXPENSE, and setting the value to <span class="uicontrol">N</span>. Then, values from the previously created
