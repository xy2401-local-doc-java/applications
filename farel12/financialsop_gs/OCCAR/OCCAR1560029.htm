                              are built off of the Oracle Financial Reporting Studio using data
                              in the Oracle Fusion General Ledger balances cube. For example, company
                              income statements and balance sheets. These reports are mainly run
                              by users in General Ledger.

                              groups are used to monitor key accounts in General Ledger. When a

                              Reporting Center with the Sunburst visualization tool. The Sunburst
                              visualization tool lets you interact with your account balances across
                              various business dimensions to view balances from different perspectives.
                              Account groups are used only in General Ledger.

                              These queries are mainly for users in General Ledger. To share Smart View
                              queries, users can e-mail them to other users, or they can upload
                              the queries to the Financial Reporting Center where users can download
                              them to a local drive for use. The Financial Reporting Center is only
                              a place for users to upload and download Smart View queries.
