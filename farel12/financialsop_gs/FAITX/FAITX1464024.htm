                        <h4 class="topictitle">Tax Regimes</h4>
                        
                        <p>Set up tax regimes in each country and geographical
                           region where you do business and where a separate tax applies. A tax
                           regime associates a common set of default information, regulations,
                           fiscal classifications, and optionally, registrations, to one or more
                           taxes. For example, in the US, create a Sales and Use Tax tax regime
                           to group taxes levied at the state, county, and district levels. For
                           the UK, create a tax regime for GB VAT. 
                        </p>
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="sect3" id="FAITX158299">
                        <h4 class="topictitle">Taxes</h4>
                        
                        <p>Set up details for the taxes of a tax regime. Each
                           separate tax in a tax regime includes records for the tax statuses,
                           tax rates, and tax rules that are used to calculate and report on
                           the tax.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, for US Sales and Use Tax define a tax
                           for each state, county, and city. For the UK, set up a tax for GB
                           VAT.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                     </div>
                     
                     <div class="sect3" id="FAITX158300">
                        <h4 class="topictitle">Tax Jurisdictions</h4>
                        
                        <p>Set up tax jurisdictions for geographic regions or
                           tax zones where a specific tax authority levies a tax. A tax jurisdiction
                           specifies the association between a tax and a geographic location.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>You also use tax jurisdictions to define jurisdiction-based
                           tax rates. A tax jurisdiction tax rate is a rate that's distinct to
                           a specific geographic region or tax zone for a specific tax.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, for US Sales and Use Tax create a county
                           jurisdiction for every county in the parent geography type of State
                           and in the parent geography name of California. For the UK, create

                           owner. A tax status is the taxable nature of a product in the context
                           of a transaction and specific tax on the transaction.

                           status for standard and exempt. For the UK set up separate tax statuses
                           for standard, zero, exempt, and reduced rates.

                           For tax statuses, set up a tax rate record for each applicable tax
                           rate that a tax status identifies. For tax jurisdictions, set up tax

                        <p>You must set up at least one tax jurisdiction for
                           a tax before you can make the tax available on transactions.

                        <p>You can use tax jurisdictions to define jurisdiction-based
                           tax rates. A tax jurisdiction tax rate is a rate that's distinct to
                           a specific geographic region or tax zone for a specific tax.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can also create multiple jurisdictions at once

                           Trading Community Model geographic hierarchies. For example, create
                           a county jurisdiction for every county in the parent geography type
                           of State and in the parent geography name of California.

                        <p>The tax within a tax jurisdiction can have different
                           rates for the parent and child geographies. For example, a city sales
                           tax rate can override a county rate for the same tax. In this case,
                           you can set up an override geography type for the city and apply a
                           precedence level to the city and county tax jurisdictions to indicate
                           which tax jurisdiction takes precedence.

                           applies to the incorporated area of the city, called the inner city.
                           In these cases, you can set up an inner city tax jurisdiction with
                           its own tax rate for the applicable customers and receivables tax.
                           Inner city tax jurisdictions are often based on postal code groupings.

                           the supply of most goods and services in Canada, set the Tax Applicability
                           default to <span class="uicontrol">Applicable</span>. A luxury
                           tax, on the other hand, is a tax on luxury goods or products not considered
                           essential. As it doesn't apply to most goods and services, set the
                           Tax Applicability direct tax rule default to <span class="uicontrol">Not Applicable</span>. Then create a tax rule to make the tax
                           applicable when the product in the transaction satisfies the luxury
                           requirement.

                        tax configuration setup to meet the basic requirements in Canada for
                        the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Set up a tax regime for both GST
                        and Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). Create one recovery type for the fully
                        recoverable status of the transaction.

                     <p>In Canada, GST is a tax that applies to the supply
                        of most property and services in Canada. The provinces of British
                        Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and
                        Labrador, referred to as the participating provinces, combine their
                        provincial sales tax with GST to create HST. Generally, HST applies
                        to the same base of property and services as the GST. Every province
                        in Canada except Alberta has implemented either provincial sales tax
                        or the HST. In countries like Canada, some or all taxes on business
                        transactions for registered companies are recoverable taxes.

                     <h3>Using Define Tax Configuration Setup for Withholding Tax: Points to Consider</h3>
                     <p>Similar to setting up your transaction taxes,
                        you use the Define Tax Configuration tasks to set up your withholding
                        taxes. Many of the setup options are common between transaction tax
                        and withholding tax setup. However, there are some differences in
                        setting up your withholding taxes to consider.
                     </p>
                     <p>Some of those differences occur in the following

                     <p>When you create a tax regime, you specify the options
                        and defaults available to the taxes associated with the tax regime.
                        You also enable the features that apply to the tax regime and its
                        taxes.

                        Information region on the Edit Tax Regime page result from the features

                        within this tax regime. If you didn't select the option in one of
                        the taxes, the option appears as not selected.

                        the <span class="uicontrol">Allow multiple jurisdictions</span> option at the tax level. When you open the Edit Tax Regime page,
                        Associated Taxes Setup Information region for this tax regime, the <span class="uicontrol">Allow multiple jurisdictions</span> option appears

                           requirement, the option for configuring the inclusiveness is made

                           data tabs. The tax determination process uses a hierarchy approach
                           to evaluate the defined setup and applies the inclusiveness option
                           on the transaction.

                        <p>The tax configuration owner is a business unit, legal
                           entity, or the global configuration owner that owns the data. The
                           global configuration owner is an abstract owner. It is used to define
                           the owner of content that can be shared by any business units and
                           first-party legal entities.

                           parent first-party organization. This allows the configuration to
                           be owned by a specific first party and shared by other parties. You
                           can then share this setup with another first-party legal entity or
                           business unit for their transactions. Use a parent first-party organization
                           tax configuration to share among a group of first-party organizations.
                           However, you still have the tax setup managed by a single first-party
                           organization.

                           the Create Tax Regime privilege, you have update rights to all tax
                           configuration data maintained by the global configuration owner.

                           or mergers may mean that there could be a future need to share content.
                           In this case, the original first party legal entity can act as the
                           configuration owner and then any subsequent first party can subscribe
                           to the first party's content using the parent first party configuration

                     <p>A service subscription is the setup for provider
                        services. It applies to the transactions of one configuration option
                        setup for a combination of tax regime and legal entity or business
                        unit. You can use the tax services of certain external service providers
                        like Taxware LP and Vertex Inc.for tax calculation of US Sales and

                     <p>Throughout Oracle Fusion Tax care is taken
                        to minimize your effort in creating setup. One way of doing this is
                        the extensive use of defaulting so that you can enter your data once
                        and use the defaults that appear on the subordinate or child records
                        where applicable. For example, many values you enter on the tax regime
                        appear as defaults on each tax that is associated to that tax regime.
                        Generally, you can override the data where necessary if the defaulted
                        value isn't correct.

                     <p>Also, to ensure maximum flexibility, as well as to
                        ensure that the accuracy and integrity of the data and transactions
                        are maintained, Oracle Fusion Tax makes extensive use of data-driven
                        controls that enable and control how tax functionality works. For
                        example, you have the requirement to set up tax recovery for value-added tax (VAT) processing. Enable the <span class="uicontrol">Allow tax recovery</span> option on the tax record so you can set up tax recovery rates for
                        this type of tax.

                        for tax rates and tax jurisdictions. You can override the defaulted

                        are default accounts and the actual accounts that are used for accounting

                     <p>Taxes applicable on a transaction are generally
                        calculated as the taxable basis multiplied by the tax rate equals
                        the tax amount. This calculated amount can result in an odd value
                        or with a large number of decimal place. You can configure the tax
                        setup to adjust or round the tax calculation according to the specific
                        requirements of the transacting parties and tax authority or to the
                        accepted currency denominations.

                     <p>Criteria for rounding the calculated tax amounts
                        comes from various parties involved in a transaction. For example,
                        for a purchase transaction, the rounding methodology is generally
                        specified by the supplier. Specify rounding details in your tax setup
                        to ensure that your entered invoice amount, including the calculated
                        tax, is the same as the actual invoice amount. For a Receivables invoice,
                        you can specify rounding details based on your organization's policy,
                        but for most countries the rounding criterion is directed by tax legislation.

                     <h3>Self-Assessment of Taxes: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Taxes for purchase transactions are usually
                        calculated by the supplier and included in the invoice. The responsibility
                        of collecting and remitting these taxes to the authority lies with
                        the supplier. However, in certain cases the supplier doesn't have
                        presence (nexus) or isn't registered in the customer location. Taxes
                        applicable in such cases, in the customer location, are self assessed
                        by the purchasing organization. Unlike supplier assessed taxes that
                        are paid to the supplier, self-assessed taxes are remitted by the
                        purchasing organization directly to the tax authority.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The key here is that these taxes are to be calculated
                        on the same invoice, but these shouldn't impact the amount payable
                        to the supplier, instead it should be accounted for as a tax liability.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The core requirements remain the same, however, the
                        terminology used for self-assessed taxes vary by tax regime, such
                        as reverse charges, use taxes, and offset taxes. Reverse charge is
                        the terminology primarily used in the European Union, use taxes is
                        the terminology used in the United States, and offset taxes is a alternate
                        solution to handle self-assessment of taxes and is not used by any
                        regime.

                        <p>Taxes must be self-assessed by the purchasing organization
                           when the supplier isn't registered in the ship-to or bill-to location
                           of the transaction. This is the recommended approach for defining
                           and calculating self-assessed taxes. This is driven based on the registration
                           party used for the transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Registration Party</p>
                        
                        <p>In the context of a tax applicable to the transaction
                           it is the party whose registration must be considered. The tax registration
                           party type default is specified for the tax. As most of the taxes
                           are assessed by the supplier, the default is set to the ship-from
                           or the bill-from location.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Supplier Tax Registration</p>
                        
                        <p>You can define tax registration for the supplier,
                           the supplier site, and for a particular tax regime. If the tax registration
                           varies by tax or tax jurisdiction, define the registration at a granular
                           level. If the supplier doesn't have presence in a specific jurisdiction,
                           there are two options for configuration. The first is to create a
                           tax registration record with the registration status as not registered.
                           The second option is not to define a registration record. If you follow
                           the second option, when you define the condition set, set the operator
                           for the Registration determining factor class to <span class="uicontrol">Is blank</span>.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Registration Party of the First Party</p>
                        
                        <p>Similar to the supplier registration, you can define
                           the tax registration records for a legal reporting unit tax profile.
                           For the tax registration of the first party select the <span class="uicontrol">Set as self-assessment (reverse charge)</span> option.
                           This option triggers self-assessment of taxes when the registration
                           party selected for the tax line is that of the first party. Self-assessment
                           is only applicable for Payables transactions. The option on the first
                           party registration doesn't impact Receivables transactions. Create
                           a tax registration rule to conditionally use the first party registration
                           when the supplier isn't registered. The condition to use for this
                           tax rule is as follows:

                        <p>Offset taxes is a backward compatible approach that
                           is configured to self-assess taxes. Configure offset taxes in addition
                           to your regular taxes. Offset taxes carry a negative rate, and are
                           calculated in the context of the regular tax. Where offset taxes are
                           applicable, the application creates two tax lines with one positive
                           and one negative amount. An offset tax record is a matching, duplicate
                           record with negative amounts that reduces or completely offsets the
                           tax liability recorded in the tax transaction. Use offset taxes when
                           the tax requirement includes creating an offset general ledger posting.

                           When these taxes are applicable to the transactions, records are created

                           created for these taxes. Therefore, there is no impact to the payable

                           be calculated in the context of the transaction. The application creates
                           both summary and detail tax lines for these taxes. The self-assessed
                           option is enabled for these lines. Invoice lines aren't created for
                           taxes. Therefore, the payable to the supplier doesn't include these
                           taxes. Invoice distributions are created to account for the tax expense
                           or recovery and liability.

                           is displayed as a separate line in the tax charges region of the invoice.

                        <p>Self-assessed taxes are created for imported payables
                           invoices. This happens when imported transactions have tax lines along

                           that are found applicable are treated as self-assessed taxes.

                        <p>These taxes are accounted along with the rest of
                           the invoice. The accounting treatment for expense and recovery remain
                           the same as any supplier-assessed taxes. The only variation is that
                           the tax amount is credited to the tax liability account instead of
                           the payables account.

                        <p>Self-assessed taxes are a part of the standard tax
                           reports. Apart from this, Oracle Fusion Subledger Accounting provides
                           reports for accounting activity that can be used to track self-assessed
                           tax liability. Use the Account Analysis Report and the Open Account
                           Balance Listing report to track this liability.

                        <p>You can override the self-assessed flag for the tax
                           line. This impacts the invoice lines and distributions. If you update

                           to reflect this change. If the self-assessed option on some of the
                           detail tax lines is updated then a new summary tax line is created
                           to group the detail tax lines that are being self-assessed.

                     <p>Offset taxes are a backward compatible approach
                        that you can configure to self-assess taxes. Configure offset taxes
                        in addition to the regular taxes. Offset taxes carry a negative rate,
                        and are calculated in the context of the regular tax. Where offset
                        taxes are applicable, two tax lines are created with one positive
                        and one negative amount. An offset tax record is a matching, duplicate
                        record with negative amounts that reduces or completely offsets the
                        tax liability recorded in the tax transaction. Use offset taxes when
                        the tax requirement includes creating an offset general ledger posting.

                     <p>The tax determination process identifies the tax rate when taxes are
                        considered applicable on a transaction. Tax rates can apply to a specific
                        location or jurisdiction. For example, you define state, county, and
                        city jurisdiction-based rates for a US Sales and Use Tax regime. Tax
                        rates can change over time. For example, when a tax rate increase
                        occurs, you end date one rate period definition and create a rate
                        period with an effective start date.

                     <p>You must set up tax rates for tax statuses and optionally for tax jurisdictions. For tax statuses, set up tax rate records for each applicable tax
                        rate that a tax status identifies. For tax jurisdictions, set up tax
                        rate records to identify the tax rate variations for a specified tax
                        and tax status within different tax jurisdictions. Set up your tax

                        tax jurisdictions when defining the tax rate setup to determine applicable
                        tax rates on a transaction.

                        <p>A tax status is the taxable nature of a product in
                           the context of a transaction and a specific tax on the transaction.
                           You define a tax status to group one or more tax rates that are of
                           the same or similar nature. Each tax must have at least one status
                           defined and one status assigned as a default. Create tax rules to
                           set alternate values as required.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, one tax can have separate tax statuses
                           for standard and manually entered tax rates.
                        </p>

                        <h4 class="topictitle">Tax Jurisdictions</h4>
                        
                        <p>A tax jurisdiction is an incidence of a tax on a specific
                           geographical area. A tax jurisdiction is limited by a geographical
                           boundary that encloses a contiguous political or administrative area,
                           most commonly the borders of a country. Often this is represented
                           by a state, province, city, county, or even a tax zone. In Oracle
                           Fusion Tax, a tax jurisdiction can use the geography setup from your
                           Oracle Fusion Trading Community Model geography hierarchy to identify
                           a tax rate. Taxes such as Canada's Harmonize Sales Tax (HST) and Provincial
                           Sales Tax may require tax rates at the jurisdiction level.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, US Sales and Use Tax are applicable based
                           upon the jurisdictions you generally define for state, county, and
                           city geographies.
                        </p>

                        <p>You must set up at least one tax rate for each tax
                           status. You can set up additional tax rates at the tax jurisdiction
                           level if the applicable tax rate is unique for a particular tax jurisdiction.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>For example, in Canada, HST is applied at a 13% rate
                           in most provinces that have adopted HST. British Columbia and Nova
                           Scotia are exceptions with tax rates of 12% and 15% respectively. To
                           satisfy this requirement, define a single tax rate of 13% with no
                           tax jurisdiction associated. Also define 12% and 15% tax rates and
                           associate them with the British Columbia and Nova Scotia jurisdictions
                           respectively. This minimizes setup by creating an exception-based
                           setup and a default option for the most commonly utilized tax rate
                           percentage.

                        <p>Tax Rate Types</p>
                        
                        <p>You can express tax rates in terms of percentage or
                           quantity. A quantity-based tax rate is based upon the number of items
                           purchased or events that occur. For example, a taxing jurisdiction
                           passes a law that each package of cigarettes sold is subject to a
                           tax of 0.87 USD. This tax is considered a quantity-based tax as it
                           is assessed based upon the number of packages purchased and not the
                           price of the product.

                           the tax rate code you define is applicable within a specific product
                           and set assignment at transaction time. In addition, the set assignment
                           of tax classification codes is derived based on the configuration
                           owner that is part of the tax rate code definition.

                        <p>You can define one or more rate periods for a tax

                           You can define default effective periods for tax rate periods. This

                           a default when existing rate periods exist on another tax rate code.
                           Define tax rules as exceptions to default tax rates.

                           to the tax rate code. If the tax rule doesn't evaluate to true at
                           transaction time then the default tax recovery rate is applicable.
                           Ensure that the tax recovery rate and tax rate periods overlap or

                        <p>This scenario includes tax calculation for a Canadian
                           tax regime. Purchases made in Ontario are generally taxed for Provincial
                           Sales Tax (PST) at a tax rate of 8%. Accommodation purchases are generally
                           taxed at 5% and food is generally exempt from tax.
                        </p>
                        <p>EDC Corporation's Ontario store has been invoiced
                           for employee accommodations, including hotel facilitates and food
                           for a conference they attended. The invoice is for a hotel room, use
                           of hotel office facilities, and food.
                        </p>
                        <p>Set up tax rates to meet PST requirements for the
                           store in Ontario as follows:
                        </p>

                              <p>Define a jurisdiction-based tax rate
                                 of 8% which is applicable to the hotel facilities usage. This is the
                                 standard tax calculation for the jurisdiction of Ontario.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Define a rate exception with a special
                                 rate of 5% for the hotel room. This exception can be driven by a product
                                 fiscal classification.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Define a Determine Tax Status rule
                                 which points to the exempt status of 0% rate for food based on a product
                                 fiscal classification. Use the tax rule over an exception since you
                                 can use a specific tax status and the default rate of 0% for that
                                 tax status.

                        <p>Another example of tax calculation for a Canadian

                           have a First Nations Tax that is applicable at a tax rate of 5%. 
                           Since the requirements drive the applicability of the tax as well
                           as the tax status and tax rate you can define a direct rate rule to
                           handle both the applicability and the tax rate.

                     <p>Tax recovery is the full or
                        partial recovery of tax paid on purchases by a registered establishment
                        to offset the tax collected from sales transactions. There are usually
                        many regulations surrounding the details of tax recovery. For example,
                        in most European countries, tax is fully recoverable on all purchases
                        except for businesses that only sell nontaxable supplies, such as
                        financial institutions. In cases in which businesses only sell nontaxable
                        supplies, value-added
                        tax (VAT) on their purchases is not recoverable. In certain
                        countries like Canada, more than one type of recovery is possible.
                        Tax authorities designate the tax recovery rates that indicate the
                        extent of recovery for a specific tax.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Tax recovery information on a transaction may be viewed
                        on the invoice distributions level, including any pertinent information
                        for nonrecoverable and recoverable taxes where applicable.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If the recovery rate on a tax varies based on one
                        or more transaction factors, set up recovery rate rules to determine
                        the appropriate recovery rate on the transaction. For example, most
                        VAT-type taxes allow full recovery of taxes paid on goods and services
                        that relate to taxable business supplies. In cases where an organization
                        makes purchases relating to both taxable and exempt supplies, the
                        tax authority can designate a partial recovery rate to reflect the
                        proportion that relates to the taxable supplies. For instance, in
                        the UK, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have two methods
                        to work out the tax recovery rate percentage:

                     <ul>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Standard method: Taxable supplies
                              divided by the value of all supplies added together (both taxable
                              and exempt). This formula is based on a previous period with an adjustment
                              when the actual proportions are known.

                              must produce a fair and reasonable result. Approval to use this special
                              method is based on the business type, the types of supplies, and the
                              business's cost structure.

                           a complex tax model. A simple tax model makes use of the default values
                           without extensive processing while a complex tax model considers each
                           tax requirement related to a transaction before making the final calculation.

                           transaction. If the first rule is successfully evaluated, the result
                           associated with the rule is used. If not, the next rule is evaluated
                           until either a successful evaluation or default value is found.

                        <p>The tax determination process is organized into rule
                           types. Each rule type identifies a particular step in the determination
                           and calculation of taxes on transactions. The rule type and related
                           process used for tax recovery determination is Determine Recovery
                           Rate. This is an optional setup that is applicable to taxes that have
                           tax recovery enabled.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the recovery rate to apply
                           to each recovery type for each applicable tax on the transaction that
                           allows for full, partial, or no recovery of the tax amount. In many
                           cases, the tax determination process uses either the recovery rate
                           associated with the tax rate or the default recovery rate defined
                           for the tax. However, if the tax recovery rate varies according to
                           determining factors, such as intended use, then create a Determine
                           Recovery Rate tax rule to derive the recovery rate.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can only set up a Determine Recovery Rate tax
                           rule for taxes that have the tax recovery option enabled. For countries
                           with multiple recovery types, use primary and secondary recovery types
                           to address this requirement. After the recovery rate is determined
                           for each recovery type, the tax determination process determines the
                           recoverable amounts against each recovery type for each tax line.
                           The remaining tax amount becomes the nonrecoverable tax amount for
                           the tax line.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The following outlines the process that results in
                           a recoverable tax amount for each recoverable tax distribution:
                        </p>
                        
                        <ol>

                              <p>Allocate tax amount per item distributions.
                                 While taxes are determined at the transaction line level, tax recovery
                                 is determined at the transaction line distribution, or item distribution
                                 level.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Determine recovery types. The tax
                                 determination process determines for each tax and item distribution,
                                 whether the primary and, if defined, secondary recovery types apply.
                                 The result of this process is a tax distribution for each recovery
                                 type for each tax and item distribution. If recovery types aren't
                                 defined, go to step 5.

                                 The tax determination process applies the recovery rates to the apportioned
                                 tax amounts to determine the recoverable tax amounts. This process

                                 Oracle Fusion Tax calculates the difference between the apportioned
                                 tax amount of every tax line per item distribution and the sum of
                                 the recoverable tax distribution to arrive at the nonrecoverable tax
                                 amount, and then creates a nonrecoverable tax distribution for this
                                 amount. If a primary recovery type wasn't defined for a tax, the entire
                                 apportioned amount for the item distribution is designated as the

                        and services as GST. In countries like Canada, some or all of the
                        taxes on business transactions for registered companies are recoverable

                        a balance against taxes owed. A tax recovery rate identifies the percentage
                        of recovery for a tax designated by the tax authority for a specific
                        transaction line. You can review Oracle Fusion Payables tax distributions
                        and, if applicable, update the tax recovery rate on a tax distribution

                           generally, the application classifies the transaction line based on
                           the item. If you are using noninventory-based product category fiscal
                           classifications, you enter the appropriate product category on all
                           applicable lines to influence the tax result.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> Product categories and product fiscal classifications
                           are defined in a hierarchical structure. It is important that you
                           select the appropriate level where the tax exception is applicable.
                           For product fiscal classifications to be used in item exceptions,
                           you must indicate that it is used in item exceptions at the tax regime
                           association to the product fiscal classification. You can set up only
                           one product fiscal classification for any specific tax regime with
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Used in Item Exceptions</span> option
                           selected.

                        <p>When you set up configuration options for first-party
                           legal entities and business units, you can set a separate configuration
                           option for the owning and sharing of product tax exceptions for a
                           combination of party and tax regime.

                        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Allow tax exceptions</span> option is set at the tax regime level and you can override it at
                           the tax and tax status levels. However, the setup you define for the
                           tax rate is what is evaluated during tax rate determination.

                        <p> At transaction time, the tax exception is used if
                           the details of the transaction and the tax match all of the entities

                           a transaction line for a specific tax.

                        <p>The tax determination process determines tax applicability,
                           tax status, and the tax rate for the transaction line. If tax exceptions
                           are allowed, the application looks at the item entered on the transaction
                           line to determine if an exception is defined at the tax, tax status,
                           tax rate, tax jurisdiction, Inventory organization, or Inventory level
                           and uses the exception at the most specific level.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the application doesn't find any tax exception for
                           the item, it looks for a product fiscal classification associated
                           with the transaction line. If one exists, the application determines
                           if an exception is defined at the tax, tax status, tax rate, tax jurisdiction,
                           and product fiscal classification level and uses the exception at
                           the most specific level with the highest precedence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The tax rate is then based on the exception type and
                           calculated as follows:
                        </p>

                              <p>Discount: A reduction of the base tax
                                 rate. For example, if the discount is 15% off the standard rate and
                                 the standard rate is 10%, then the discount rate is 85% of the original
                                 10%, or 8.5%.

                                 tax rate. For example, if the surcharge is 10% and the standard rate
                                 is 10%, then the surcharge rate is 110% of the original 10%, or 11%.

                              <p>Special Rate: A rate that replaces
                                 the base tax rate. For example, if the special rate is 5% and the
                                 standard rate is 10%, the tax rate is the special rate of 5%.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                        <p>Finally, the new tax rate is applied to the taxable
                           basis and the tax amount is calculated.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For manual tax lines, no additional processing is
                           performed and exceptions aren't considered. A manual tax lines suggests
                           that you have specific business requirements for a particular transaction
                           to apply a manual tax. No additional processing is performed for manual
                           tax lines to avoid any applying conflicting or inconsistent values
                           to the user-entered tax line. The tax calculation on a manual tax
                           line is the standard formula of: tax amount is equal to the taxable
                           basis multiplied by the tax rate.

                        <p>In the automatic approach, you can configure
                           the tax setup and calculate the tax on a transaction as inclusive
                           of the item line amount. Since the tax legislation and the business
                           relationship between the transacting parties primarily drive this
                           requirement, the option for configuring the inclusiveness is made
                           available on the tax and tax rate definition and the third party and
                           legal reporting unit tax profiles on the tax registration and general
                           data tabs. The tax determination process uses a hierarchy approach
                           to evaluate the defined setup and applies the inclusiveness option
                           on the transaction.

                     <p>Taxes applicable on a transaction are generally
                        calculated as the taxable basis multiplied by the tax rate equals
                        the tax amount. This calculated amount can result in an odd value
                        or with a large number of decimal place. You can configure the tax
                        setup to adjust or round the tax calculation according to the specific
                        requirements of the transacting parties and tax authority or to the
                        accepted currency denominations.

                     <p>Criteria for rounding the calculated tax amounts
                        comes from various parties involved in a transaction. For example,
                        for a purchase transaction, the rounding methodology is generally
                        specified by the supplier. Specify rounding details in your tax setup
                        to ensure that your entered invoice amount, including the calculated
                        tax, is the same as the actual invoice amount. For a Receivables invoice,
                        you can specify rounding details based on your organization's policy,
                        but for most countries the rounding criterion is directed by tax legislation.

                     <h3>Self-Assessment of Taxes: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Taxes for purchase transactions are usually
                        calculated by the supplier and included in the invoice. The responsibility
                        of collecting and remitting these taxes to the authority lies with
                        the supplier. However, in certain cases the supplier doesn't have
                        presence (nexus) or isn't registered in the customer location. Taxes
                        applicable in such cases, in the customer location, are self assessed
                        by the purchasing organization. Unlike supplier assessed taxes that
                        are paid to the supplier, self-assessed taxes are remitted by the
                        purchasing organization directly to the tax authority.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The key here is that these taxes are to be calculated
                        on the same invoice, but these shouldn't impact the amount payable
                        to the supplier, instead it should be accounted for as a tax liability.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The core requirements remain the same, however, the
                        terminology used for self-assessed taxes vary by tax regime, such
                        as reverse charges, use taxes, and offset taxes. Reverse charge is
                        the terminology primarily used in the European Union, use taxes is
                        the terminology used in the United States, and offset taxes is a alternate
                        solution to handle self-assessment of taxes and is not used by any
                        regime.

                        <p>Taxes must be self-assessed by the purchasing organization
                           when the supplier isn't registered in the ship-to or bill-to location
                           of the transaction. This is the recommended approach for defining
                           and calculating self-assessed taxes. This is driven based on the registration
                           party used for the transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Registration Party</p>
                        
                        <p>In the context of a tax applicable to the transaction
                           it is the party whose registration must be considered. The tax registration
                           party type default is specified for the tax. As most of the taxes
                           are assessed by the supplier, the default is set to the ship-from
                           or the bill-from location.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Supplier Tax Registration</p>
                        
                        <p>You can define tax registration for the supplier,
                           the supplier site, and for a particular tax regime. If the tax registration
                           varies by tax or tax jurisdiction, define the registration at a granular
                           level. If the supplier doesn't have presence in a specific jurisdiction,
                           there are two options for configuration. The first is to create a
                           tax registration record with the registration status as not registered.
                           The second option is not to define a registration record. If you follow
                           the second option, when you define the condition set, set the operator
                           for the Registration determining factor class to <span class="uicontrol">Is blank</span>.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Registration Party of the First Party</p>
                        
                        <p>Similar to the supplier registration, you can define
                           the tax registration records for a legal reporting unit tax profile.
                           For the tax registration of the first party select the <span class="uicontrol">Set as self-assessment (reverse charge)</span> option.
                           This option triggers self-assessment of taxes when the registration
                           party selected for the tax line is that of the first party. Self-assessment
                           is only applicable for Payables transactions. The option on the first
                           party registration doesn't impact Receivables transactions. Create
                           a tax registration rule to conditionally use the first party registration
                           when the supplier isn't registered. The condition to use for this
                           tax rule is as follows:

                        <p>Offset taxes is a backward compatible approach that
                           is configured to self-assess taxes. Configure offset taxes in addition
                           to your regular taxes. Offset taxes carry a negative rate, and are
                           calculated in the context of the regular tax. Where offset taxes are
                           applicable, the application creates two tax lines with one positive
                           and one negative amount. An offset tax record is a matching, duplicate
                           record with negative amounts that reduces or completely offsets the
                           tax liability recorded in the tax transaction. Use offset taxes when
                           the tax requirement includes creating an offset general ledger posting.

                           When these taxes are applicable to the transactions, records are created
                           in the tax repository entities. However, invoice distributions aren't
                           created for these taxes. Therefore, there is no impact to the payable
                           amount, payment amount, and invoice accounting.

                        Taxes Are Processed</h4>
                        
                        <p>Taxes created by the first party organization must
                           be calculated in the context of the transaction. The application creates
                           both summary and detail tax lines for these taxes. The self-assessed
                           option is enabled for these lines. Invoice lines aren't created for
                           taxes. Therefore, the payable to the supplier doesn't include these
                           taxes. Invoice distributions are created to account for the tax expense
                           or recovery and liability.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Self-assessed taxes aren't included in the invoice
                           totals. Instead, the total of self-assessed taxes for the invoice
                           is displayed as a separate line in the tax charges region of the invoice.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Self-assessed taxes are created for imported payables
                           invoices. This happens when imported transactions have tax lines along
                           with transaction lines and if you enable the <span class="uicontrol">Perform additional applicability for imported documents</span> option for the event class. For these transactions, additional taxes
                           that are found applicable are treated as self-assessed taxes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>These taxes are accounted along with the rest of
                           the invoice. The accounting treatment for expense and recovery remain
                           the same as any supplier-assessed taxes. The only variation is that
                           the tax amount is credited to the tax liability account instead of
                           the payables account.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Self-assessed taxes are a part of the standard tax
                           reports. Apart from this, Oracle Fusion Subledger Accounting provides
                           reports for accounting activity that can be used to track self-assessed
                           tax liability. Use the Account Analysis Report and the Open Account
                           Balance Listing report to track this liability.

                        <p>You can override the self-assessed flag for the tax
                           line. This impacts the invoice lines and distributions. If you update
                           the summary tax line, all corresponding detail tax lines are updated
                           to reflect this change. If the self-assessed option on some of the
                           detail tax lines is updated then a new summary tax line is created
                           to group the detail tax lines that are being self-assessed.

                     <p>Offset taxes are a backward compatible approach
                        that you can configure to self-assess taxes. Configure offset taxes
                        in addition to the regular taxes. Offset taxes carry a negative rate,
                        and are calculated in the context of the regular tax. Where offset
                        taxes are applicable, two tax lines are created with one positive
                        and one negative amount. An offset tax record is a matching, duplicate
                        record with negative amounts that reduces or completely offsets the
                        tax liability recorded in the tax transaction. Use offset taxes when
                        the tax requirement includes creating an offset general ledger posting.

                           by the negative amount credited to the payables account due to the
                           offset tax line. The debit of the offset tax line is posted to the

                           first-party legal entities.

                           parent first-party organization. This allows the configuration to
                           be owned by a specific first party and shared by other parties. You
                           can then share this setup with another first-party legal entity or
                           business unit for their transactions. Use a parent first-party organization
                           tax configuration to share among a group of first-party organizations.
                           However, you still have the tax setup managed by a single first-party
                           organization.

                           the same party or regime definitions. Specify effective start and

                           Once you set this option the application records the date it occurred
                           as the start date. This date is used and compared to the transaction

                           in preference to the subscription of the business unit. The specific
                           first-party legal entity that is used is defined by the legal entity

                           or mergers may mean that there could be a future need to share content.
                           In this case, the original first party legal entity can act as the
                           configuration owner and then any subsequent first party can subscribe
                           to the first party's content using the parent first party configuration
                           with party override. Alternatively, set up the original tax content

                        tax jurisdiction where it conducts business. In some cases, a single
                        location may need to file multiple registrations. Set up tax registrations

                        tax authorities is a key legal requirement in many countries. A unique
                        tax registration number is generally assigned to the parties registering
                        with the tax authorities. It is used as a basis for referencing and
                        tracking the tax implications on that party. To enable this process,
                        the registration numbers of the parties involved in a transaction
                        are generally referred to in tax documents like invoices and tax returns.
                        In some cases, the tax determination and its administration is also
                        dependent on the nature of the registration of the parties involved
                        in a transaction. For example, the requirements associated with intra-European

                        <p>For each tax that you create, you must define either
                           a default tax registration or a tax rule for the rule type Determine
                           Tax Registration. If a party has more than one tax registration under
                           the same tax regime, then the tax determination process considers
                           the tax registrations in the order: tax jurisdiction; tax; and tax
                           regime.

                        <p>For some countries, the application performs a validation
                           of the registration number you enter per the country algorithm.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>You can define tax registrations as implicit. For
                           example, the party isn't formally registered with the tax authority,
                           but the party is considered to meet one or more requirements for reporting
                           taxes because of the level of business conducted, typically a minimum
                           presence in the country and a minimum revenue threshold.  Also, you
                           can define the tax registration with a status of not registered if
                           the party isn't registered for the applicable tax, but you want to
                           use it as a tax condition to process the tax rules. Similarly, you
                           can use user-defined values and statuses, such as registered in EU
                           but not UK, to facilitate certain tax conditions. Apart from the core
                           tax registration information, you define additional details to facilitate
                           tax processing. The invoice control attributes such as self-assessment
                           and tax inclusiveness play a key role in tax processing. At transaction
                           time, the values set at the tax registration level override the values
                           set at the party tax profile level.

                        Process</h4>
                        
                        <p>The Determine Tax Registration process determines

                           and, if available, derives the tax registration number. Once the process
                           identifies the tax registration or registrations, it stamps the transaction
                           with the tax registration numbers.

                           tax rules. For example, if the tax is applicable only if the supplier
                           is registered, define the tax applicability rule as follows:

                           stamps two registration numbers. One is for the headquarters, the

                           rule. For example, if the registration rule has identified ship to
                           as a party, then the tax determination process stamps the registration
                           number of the ship-to party on the transaction.

                     <p>A tax exemption is a full or partial exclusion from taxes or
                        a surcharge, based on certain criteria given by the tax legislation.
                        Many countries allow tax exemptions when certain parties deal with
                        certain categories of goods and services. For example, most states
                        and localities imposing sales and use taxes in the United States provide
                        tax exemptions to resellers on goods held for sale and ultimately
                        sold. States and localities also provide tax exemptions on goods used
                        directly in the production of other goods, such as raw materials.

                        <p>A tax exemption record identifies the nature
                           of the tax exemption, the configuration owner, and tax regime, and,
                           where applicable, the related tax, tax status, tax rate, and tax jurisdictions
                           to which the tax exemption belongs.

                        <p>During the life of a tax exemption, the tax exemption
                           status can often change. The possible statuses are: <span class="uicontrol">Primary</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Manual</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Unapproved</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Discontinued</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Rejected</span>. Because the status of the tax exemption affects
                           its applicability on the transaction line, you must update the tax
                           exemption record each time the status changes. These rules apply to
                           the status of the tax exemption:

                                 as the tax exemption percentage. This defines a discount rate that
                                 is 85% of the original 10%, or 8.5%.

                           2% discount. The tax exemption discount is applicable to the tax rate
                           after the tax exception. Therefore, the 5% tax rate is modified by
                           a 2% discount (5% * (100%-2%) = 4.9%). If the tax exemption defined
                           is of the rate type of <span class="uicontrol">Special rate</span> then the special rate is substituted and the applicable tax exception
                           has no impact.

                        <p>For manual tax lines, no additional processing is
                           performed and tax exemptions are not considered. A manual tax line
                           suggests that you have specific business requirements for a particular
                           transaction to apply a manual tax. No additional processing is performed
                           for manual tax lines to avoid any applying conflicting or inconsistent
                           values to the user-entered tax line. The tax calculation on a manual
                           tax line is the standard formula of tax amount is equal to the taxable
                           basis multiplied by the tax rate.

                     <p>Tax rules, such as the Determine Tax Applicability
                        rule excludes certain categories of transactions from taxation. Such
                        transactions don't appear on many tax reports as they don't have any

                        certificates of exemptions are issued for specific customers, which
                        is typical in tax regimes for US Sales and Use Tax.

                        classification type group, which is used to retrieve all of the associated
                        levels of one transaction fiscal classification type.

                     <p>Assign each level a fiscal classification type code
                        and name with associated start and end dates. Use the fiscal classification
                        type code as the determining factor when you create tax rules. The
                        start date must be before or equal to the earliest transaction date
                        that use a tax rule associated with the applicable transaction fiscal
                        classification.

                     <p>Associate each fiscal classification type record with
                        a tax regime that is used to create tax rules. This ensures that the
                        list of values of the transaction fiscal classification is restricted
                        by the tax regime for which the tax rule is being created.

                        the header of the transaction and therefore, apply to all the transaction

                     <p>Document fiscal classifications provide a hierarchy
                        of up to five levels. When defining the document fiscal classification

                        specify the taxation countries where the document fiscal classification
                        is used.

                           items and define specific tax rules for them. For a standard item,
                           none of the explicit tax rules apply except the default rate.

                        <p>Define the party classification categories and associated
                           classification codes within the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Model
                           party classification setup. Create the party fiscal classifications,
                           and associate the specific Trading Community Model party classification
                           category to these party fiscal classifications, one for each level
                           of the specific Trading Community Model party classification category.
                           Associate tax regimes to these party classifications to ensure that
                           these relationships are only visible and usable where needed. Oracle
                           Fusion Tax uses this relationship to indicate which Trading Community
                           Model party classification categories are used for tax purposes. By
                           reusing the Trading Community Model party classification category
                           functionality, Oracle Fusion Tax can leverage and use the common classification
                           setup for tax purposes where applicable.

                           Oracle Fusion Tax. For example, if you have a three level Trading
                           Community Model party fiscal classification category, define three
                           levels, giving each a specific party fiscal classification code and
                           name. By naming each level, you can use the specific level as a determining
                           factor when defining tax rules. Use the same party fiscal classification
                           flow to define the tax regimes with which the party fiscal classifications
                           are associated.

                     <p>Party fiscal classification tax determination
                        factors allow you to use party fiscal classifications in tax rules. A combination of determination factor class, class
                        qualifier, and determining factor represent these determination factors.
                        In the tax rules setup, define the actual party to be used to determine
                        the relevant party fiscal classification by using a generic definition
                        for class qualifier. You can also use party fiscal classifications
                        for tax reporting.

                           Always use the highest applicable level to define
                           the party classification. For example, if appropriate, define the
                           party fiscal classification at the customer or supplier level instead
                           of defining the same classification on all the party sites for the
                           customer and suppliers.

                           Because party fiscal classifications are automatically
                           derived during transaction time, use them as determining factors instead
                           of process-based determining factors, which require manual entry for

                        <p>Use party classifications to classify parties for

                           instead of party fiscal classifications as it offers a more flexible
                           and less intrusive mechanism to support reporting without creating
                           unnecessary complexity in setup and maintenance.

                     <p>Legal classifications are associated with
                        a legal entity that represents its legal status within a country and
                        guides the tax determination process. Fiscal classifications determine
                        when taxes apply to a party, how much tax applies, and what percentage
                        of the tax is recoverable. Both legal and fiscal classifications are
                        defined by the Oracle Fusion Trading Community Model legal entity.

                        classification purposes. In effect, a legal classification just becomes
                        another party fiscal classification for tax purposes.

                     <p>Many tax regimes define rules for specific
                        products or types of products. This is done to stimulate or enhance
                        trade in specific products or ensure that certain products or product
                        types are excluded from taxes. To support these requirements, Oracle
                        Fusion Tax provides features to allow items to be classified. They
                        make extensive use of the Oracle Fusion Inventory catalog functionality.
                        If you don't implement Inventory, you can use product category fiscal
                        classifications as an alternative classification in Oracle Fusion
                        Tax. Set up your product classifications using the Manage Product-Based
                        Fiscal Classifications task.

                        <p>For example, value-added tax (VAT) in
                           the UK exempts children clothing and normal foods from Great Britain's
                           (GB) VAT. It's also common that tax authorities vary the tax status
                           of product types depending on how they're planned to be used. For
                           example, a company purchases products that are subject to VAT. The
                           use of these items isn't related to the company's sale of taxable
                           supplies. Therefore, the company can't recover any VAT or can only
                           partially recover VAT on those purchases.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>There has also been a recent trend to introduce antifraud
                           tax legislation for specific products so that they can be treated
                           in a different way to prevent fraud. For example, the GB Missing Trader
                           Intra Community antifraud legislation specifies that certain types
                           of business-to-business domestic supplies of certain high value electronic
                           products, such as mobile phones, computer equipment and accessories
                           are reversed charged. For more information about GB Missing Trader

                     <p>During transaction time, when the association with
                        the catalog exists, the application automatically derives the default
                        product fiscal classification code based on the items used on the
                        transaction line. When no item is defined on the transaction line,
                        you can manually enter the product fiscal classification on the transaction
                        line during transaction time. Even the default product fiscal classification
                        code is derived during the transaction time, it can be overridden
                        if necessary. The overridden product fiscal classification code is
                        used in the tax determination process.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>While creating the product fiscal classification,
                        use the number of levels to define the number of hierarchical levels
                        to link the items to. Also, specify the number of the level of classification
                        that is to be used in the tax rule setup. When creating the levels
                        within the product fiscal classification, define the start position
                        and number of characters for each level. During transaction time,
                        this ensures that all items with the same values in the start position
                        and the same number of characters are grouped into the same classification.

                        While setting up the product fiscal classification,

                        defined at the highest level possible. This minimizes the needed number

                                 While using the product fiscal classification, classify
                                 the nonstandard items of your business as standard items. You can
                                 model this as a default tax rule that doesn't require an explicit
                                 classification or an explicit rule. Classify only exception items
                                 and define specific tax rules for them. For a standard item, none
                                 of the explicit rules are applicable and the default rate applies.
                                 
                              </div>

                                 Don't add the explicit percentage to the naming or
                                 coding convention used for product fiscal classifications. When the
                                 rate changes, you change the rate period on the specific rate and
                                 you don't have to change classification or associated tax rules.

                        fiscal classifications to classify items for tax determination
                        and reporting purposes. Use product category fiscal classifications
                        when Oracle Fusion Inventory is not available. However, you can use
                        product category fiscal classifications in conjunction with product
                        fiscal classifications when Inventory is installed.

                     <p>Product category fiscal classifications use the classification
                        functionality within Oracle Fusion Tax setup to directly define the
                        classification to use. This functionality allows a hierarchy of up
                        to five levels and uses the standard hierarchical features. It also
                        allows you to associate the classification codes with specific countries.

                           factors.

                           which the reporting codes is associated. You can associate multiple

                                 While using the product category fiscal classification,
                                 only classify the nonstandard items of your business. Handle standard
                                 items by using default tax rules. Thus, for a standard item, none
                                 of the explicit tax rules are applicable and the default rate applies.
                                 
                                 <p> The standard items are included in the table only
                                    for completeness. Modeling these standard items using default tax
                                    rules may be sufficient.

                                 When the rate changes, you change the rate period on the specific

                                 rules.

                            Care should be taken when defining intended use fiscal

                           create a default. This default is not easily visible on the transaction
                           user interface and therefore, you may not be aware that a default
                           has been derived and that you may need to change it.

                                 classify the nonstandard items of your business as standard items.
                                 You can model this as a default tax rule which doesn't require an
                                 explicit classification or an explicit rule. Classify only exception
                                 items and define specific tax rules for them. For a standard item,
                                 none of the explicit rules are applicable and the default rate applies.

                     <p>Taxes are levied on transactions as per the
                        legislations in a country or region. They are seldom uniformly applied
                        on all transactions and tax legislation may seek differential levy,
                        treatment, and administration of taxes based on various transaction
                        attributes. Configure Oracle Fusion Tax to evaluate transactions based
                        on transaction attributes. The transaction attributes determine which
                        taxes apply to a transaction and how to calculate tax amount for each
                        tax that applies to the transaction.

                     <p>The tax determination process utilizes the tax foundation
                        configuration in conjunction with configuration options and tax rules
                        to process transactions for tax applicability and calculation. Tax
                        configuration ranges from simple models to complex models. Simple
                        models make use of default values without extensive processing while
                        complex models consider each tax requirement related to a transaction
                        before making the final calculation.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When setting up a tax, examine the regulations that
                        govern the determination of the tax amount, from identifying applicability
                        drivers to how the tax is calculated. Organize the regulations into
                        one or more rule types for each tax. When the regulations indicate
                        that more than one result is possible for a given rule type, you need
                        to define rules within that rule type. Otherwise you can defer to
                        a default value for that rule type associated to the tax.

                              in certain countries require a complex logic to determine the applicable
                              taxes and rates on a transaction. Both tax applicability and tax rates
                              can vary. For example, by place of origin and place of destination,
                              party registration, status, service, or a combination of factors.
                              In some cases, the taxable amount of one tax may depend upon the amount
                              of another tax on the same transaction. And in rare cases, the tax
                              amount itself may depend on the tax amount of another tax. For all
                              of these and similar situations, you set up tax rules to define the
                              logic necessary to identify each step of the tax determination process.

                        <p>The tax determination process evaluates transaction
                           header and line information to derive tax lines for taxes applicable
                           to the transactions. The first step of the determination process is
                           to identify the first party of the transaction. The tax determination
                           process looks to the business unit on the transaction. The process
                           identifies whether its pointing to the configuration owner of the
                           business unit or legal entity depending on the <span class="uicontrol">Use subscription of the legal entity</span> option. The option
                           is on the party tax profile definition of the business unit. The tax
                           determination process determines if there are configuration owner
                           tax options associated with this party or if the predefined event
                           class option should be used.

                           be the predefined TAXREGIME, STCC (standard tax classification code),
                           or another regime determination set that is user-defined. TAXREGIME
                           or user-defined regime determination sets derive the applicable tax
                           regimes or tax regime through country or zone of the location. The
                           country or zone of the location is identified in the processing of

                           determination is typically used for purposes of migrated data and
                           has a different processing logic driven by tax classification code.

                        <p>Tax regimes are considered based on geography and

                        <p>This process determines the tax applicability of
                           each candidate tax based on direct rate determination, place of supply,
                           tax applicability, and tax jurisdiction. The first step in tax applicability
                           is to process any direct rate rules defined for a tax regime, configuration
                           owner, and candidate taxes. If a direct rate rule evaluates to true
                           then place of supply is processed for this transaction tax. If successful
                           the tax is applicable and the tax status and tax rate defined for
                           the direct rate rule are used in the tax calculation. If a direct
                           rate rule does not evaluate to true for this tax regime, configuration
                           owner, and tax the tax applicability rules are processed next. After
                           a tax is found applicable based on an applicability rule or a default
                           value the process verifies the place of supply and associated tax
                           jurisdiction. This is required except in the cases of migrated taxes.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The place of supply process identifies the applicable
                           location type and associated tax jurisdiction where the supply of
                           goods or services is deemed to have taken place for a specific tax.
                           If the tax determination process cannot find a tax jurisdiction for
                           the location that corresponds to the place of supply location type,
                           the tax doesn't apply. It is removed as a candidate tax for the transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the place of supply for UK value-added tax (VAT) on goods is generally the ship-from country. Thus, the place of
                           supply of a sale or purchase within the UK is the UK itself. However,
                           if a UK legal entity supplies goods from its French warehouse to a
                           German customer, then the place of supply will not find a jurisdiction
                           for UK VAT in France, and therefore UK VAT doesn't apply.

                           is used for each tax on the transaction, and, if available, derives

                           tax on the transaction. If the process cannot find a tax status for
                           an applicable tax, then Tax raises an error.

                        <p>Determine Tax Rate</p>

                           tax and tax status derived from the previous process. First the application
                           looks for a rate based on rate code and tax jurisdiction. If this
                           isn't found then the application looks for a rate with no tax jurisdiction.
                           If applicable, the tax rate is then modified by any exception rate
                           or tax exemption that applies. The result of this process is a tax
                           rate code and tax rate for each applicable tax.

                        <p>Determine Taxable Basis</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the taxable base for each
                           tax rate code. Depending on the tax rate type the taxable basis is
                           amount based or quantity based. The tax determination process typically
                           determines the tax by applying the tax rate to the taxable base amount.
                           In some cases, the taxable basis either can include another tax or
                           is based on the tax amount of another tax. Define taxable basis formulas

                           In most cases, the tax amount is computed by applying the derived

                           the tax amount is altered by adding or subtracting another tax. Define
                           tax calculation formulas to manage these requirements.

                           VAT on normal purchases used for company business is 100% recoverable.
                           However, if you are a financial institution which only makes VAT exempt
                           on sales then you aren't allowed to recover any taxes and your recovery
                           rate is zero percent on all purchases. The recovery process impacts
                           the distribution level, tax amounts, and inclusiveness of taxes. The
                           resulting distribution amounts are adjusted as a result of the recovery
                           process. The recovery type is defined on the tax and identifies whether
                           there are one or two recovery types; primary and secondary. For each
                           tax and recovery type the application determines the recovery rate
                           based on a tax rule or default value defined on the tax.

                     <p>The tax determination process evaluates transaction
                        header and line information to derive tax lines for taxes applicable
                        to the transactions. The first step of the determination process is
                        to identify the first party of the transaction. The tax determination
                        process looks to the business unit on the transaction. The process
                        identifies whether its pointing to the configuration owner of the
                        business unit or legal entity depending on the <span class="uicontrol">Use subscription of the legal entity</span> option. The option
                        is on the party tax profile definition of the business unit. The tax
                        determination process determines if there are configuration owner
                        tax options associated with this party or if the predefined event
                        class option should be used.

                     <p>The Determine Applicable Tax Regimes process can
                        be the predefined TAXREGIME, STCC (standard tax classification code),
                        or another regime determination set that is user-defined. TAXREGIME
                        or user-defined regime determination sets derive the applicable tax
                        regimes or tax regime through country or zone of the location. The
                        country or zone of the location is identified in the processing of
                        the regime determination determining factor set location values. STCC
                        determination is typically used for purposes of migrated data and
                        has a different processing logic driven by tax classification code.
                        A third option of determination is third-party integration.

                     <p>Determine Applicable Tax Regimes and Candidate Taxes</p>
                     
                     <p>Tax regimes are considered based on geography and
                        subscription. Either a country or zone associated with the tax regime
                        definition must be the same as the country or zone identified through
                        the location that evaluates to true on the regime determination set
                        of the first party of the transaction. In addition, the tax regime
                        must have a subscription to the applicable configuration owner. Once
                        the tax determination process identifies the tax regimes the list
                        of candidate taxes can be evaluated based on the configuration option
                        setting of the first party in the tax regime subscription definition:

                              both the first party and the global configuration owner, the application
                              only uses the tax defined by the first party.

                              by the first party and the parent first party, the application only
                              uses the tax defined by the first party.

                     <p>Determine Tax Applicability and Place of Supply and
                        Tax Jurisdiction
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the tax applicability of
                        each candidate tax based on direct rate determination, place of supply,
                        tax applicability, and tax jurisdiction. The first step in tax applicability
                        is to process any direct rate rules defined for a tax regime, configuration
                        owner, and candidate taxes. If a direct rate rule evaluates to true
                        then place of supply is processed for this transaction tax. If successful
                        the tax is applicable and the tax status and tax rate defined for
                        the direct rate rule are used in the tax calculation. If a direct
                        rate rule does not evaluate to true for this tax regime, configuration
                        owner, and tax the tax applicability rules are processed next. After
                        a tax is found applicable based on an applicability rule or a default
                        value the process verifies the place of supply and associated tax
                        jurisdiction. This is required except in the cases of migrated taxes.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The place of supply process identifies the applicable
                        location type and associated tax jurisdiction where the supply of
                        goods or services is deemed to have taken place for a specific tax.
                        If the tax determination process cannot find a tax jurisdiction for
                        the location that corresponds to the place of supply location type,
                        the tax doesn't apply. It is removed as a candidate tax for the transaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, the place of supply for UK value-added tax (VAT) on goods is generally the ship-from country. Thus, the place of
                        supply of a sale or purchase within the UK is the UK itself. However,
                        if a UK legal entity supplies goods from its French warehouse to a
                        German customer, then the place of supply will not find a jurisdiction
                        for UK VAT in France, and therefore UK VAT doesn't apply.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Determine Tax Registration</p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the party whose tax registration
                        is used for each tax on the transaction, and, if available, derives
                        the tax registration number.

                     <p>Determine Tax Status</p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the tax status of each applicable
                        tax on the transaction. If the process cannot find a tax status for
                        an applicable tax, then Tax raises an error.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Determine Tax Rate</p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the tax rate code for each
                        tax and tax status derived from the previous process. First the application
                        looks for a rate based on rate code and tax jurisdiction. If this
                        isn't found then the application looks for a rate with no tax jurisdiction.
                        If applicable, the tax rate is then modified by any exception rate
                        or tax exemption that applies. The result of this process is a tax
                        rate code and tax rate for each applicable tax.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Determine Taxable Basis</p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the taxable base for each
                        tax rate code. Depending on the tax rate type the taxable basis is
                        amount based or quantity based. The tax determination process typically
                        determines the tax by applying the tax rate to the taxable base amount.
                        In some cases, the taxable basis either can include another tax or
                        is based on the tax amount of another tax. Define taxable basis formulas
                        to manage these requirements.

                     <p>Determine Tax Calculation</p>
                     
                     <p>This process calculates the tax amount on the transaction.
                        In most cases, the tax amount is computed by applying the derived
                        tax rate to the derived taxable basis. In some exceptional cases,
                        the tax amount is altered by adding or subtracting another tax. Define
                        tax calculation formulas to manage these requirements.

                     <p>Determine Tax Recovery</p>
                     
                     <p>This process determines the recovery rate to use
                        on procure-to-pay transactions when the tax allows for full or partial
                        recovery of the tax amount. For example, for UK manufacturing companies
                        VAT on normal purchases used for company business is 100% recoverable.
                        However, if you are a financial institution which only makes VAT exempt
                        on sales then you aren't allowed to recover any taxes and your recovery
                        rate is zero percent on all purchases. The recovery process impacts
                        the distribution level, tax amounts, and inclusiveness of taxes. The
                        resulting distribution amounts are adjusted as a result of the recovery
                        process. The recovery type is defined on the tax and identifies whether
                        there are one or two recovery types; primary and secondary. For each
                        tax and recovery type the application determines the recovery rate
                        based on a tax rule or default value defined on the tax. 
                     </p>

                        also be enhanced with the definition of tax rules to identify and

                        The tax determination process evaluates, in order of priority, the

                        the details on the transaction. The application processes tax rules
                        in order of evaluation until one evaluates successfully, then the

                        evaluates event-specific rules and tax event-specific rules before
                        nonevent-specific rules for the same rule type, tax regime, configuration
                        owner, and tax. Set up more specific event classes to less specific
                        tax event classes to generic tax rules applicable to all event classes.
                        Include geography information on the tax rule header as well as within
                        the determining factor or condition set detail. Including geography
                        detail doesn't change evaluation order but improves the performance
                        of tax rule processing. Include reference information, such as tax
                        law or other text, in the definition of the tax rule.

                        Always try to minimize tax rules and setup for tax
                        regimes and taxes. Tax rules are specific to a tax regime and tax.
                        Thus, by minimizing the number of tax regimes and taxes, the number
                        and complexity of the tax rules can be minimized.

                        Move any complexity from the beginning to the end
                        of the rule types and supporting setup. For example, use tax recovery
                        rate rules in preference to setting up specific tax rates with individual
                        defaults associated with tax recovery rates.

                     <p>Tax reporting requirements add some level of complexity
                        to the pure tax setup needed to support the tax determination and
                        calculation processes. Try to minimize this additional level of complexity.
                        Write tax reports wherever possible to use tax reporting codes or
                        use the determination factors that identify your reporting requirements.
                        These reporting determination factors should replace the need to create
                        specific taxes, tax statuses, and tax rates purely defined to allow
                        tax reporting.

                     <p>For extreme cases, you may need to create a more complex
                        tax setup to meet your tax reporting needs. For example, currently
                        there are no determining factors that can easily identify asset purchases.
                        In many countries, it is a requirement to report the tax associated
                        with asset purchases separately. In this case, create tax status and
                        tax rate rules based on asset account segments to uniquely allocate
                        a specific tax status and tax rate to these asset purchases. These
                        asset purchases can then be reported by searching for the specific
                        tax status and tax rate or specific tax reporting codes associated
                        with the specific tax status or tax rate.

                        tax rate rules, direct tax rate rules, account-based direct tax rate
                        rules, or tax classification-based direct tax rate rules to derive
                        the applicable tax rate.

                     <p>The tax determination process uses direct tax rate
                        rules to determine tax applicability, tax status, and tax rate. The
                        tax determination process uses a tax rate rule to determine the tax
                        rate once the tax status is determined. A direct tax rate determination
                        rule is a good choice if there are specific requirements to drive
                        a specific tax, tax status, and tax rate and no variation in tax status
                        or tax rate is required.

                         If tax applicability is impacted by the tax rate
                        but not the tax law, set up a tax status rule to point to a different
                        tax status and use a default tax rate associated with that tax status.
                        If the tax status doesn't need to be unique a tax rate rule can drive
                        a specific tax rate but keep the tax applicability and tax status
                        based on existing rules.

                           tax rules are evaluated after standard applicability rules. If a standard
                           applicability rule evaluated the tax to <span class="uicontrol">Not
                              applicable</span> then it can't be applicable through an Account-Based
                           Direct Tax Rate Determination rule.

                           rule when the regime determination for the configuration owner tax
                           option is defined as <span class="uicontrol">STCC</span> (standard
                           tax classification code). This setup is primarily intended for migrated
                           tax classification codes, specifically tax classification groups.
                           The tax classification code populated on the transaction line drives
                           the tax determination and tax rate directly. A default tax rate associated
                           to a tax rate code is not applicable in this case. Tax classification
                           codes are created automatically as user-extensible lookup codes when
                           you save a tax rate definition.

                           When selecting the normal geography qualifiers, use

                           is selected, as there are many multiple geography elements with the

                           as second in evaluation sequence it's the only other tax rule with
                           a normal event rule qualifier. Rule D is third in evaluation sequence
                           as it's the highest priority rule with a tax event rule qualifier
                           followed by rule E as the only other tax rule with a tax event rule
                           qualifier. Finally, the application evaluates rule C as it doesn't
                           have any event rule qualifiers.

                           alters the way in which the tax determination process processes the
                           tax rules. For an event class qualified tax rule, normal event or
                           tax event-based, the tax rule is evaluated first in preference to
                           tax rules qualified by tax event qualifiers or a nonevent class qualified
                           tax rule of higher priority.

                        <p>Consider that you have two rules: rule A and rule
                           C with rule priority 100 and 10 respectively. The rules are associated
                           with condition sets that match against the transaction line details.
                           Rule A has a normal event class qualifier which is satisfied while
                           rule C doesn't have an event class qualifier, rule A is processed
                           and used first regardless of the rule priority order, even though
                           rule A has a lower priority than rule C.

                           order sequence. If a condition set criteria doesn't match with the
                           transaction details, the tax determination process evaluates the next
                           condition set. If none of them match with the transaction details,
                           the next rule within the ordered rule set is considered. If a condition
                           set criteria matches with the transaction details, the tax determination
                           process considers the rule result defined against that condition set.
                           The tax rule is then marked as successfully evaluated. If none of
                           the defined rule conditions match the transaction details, then the
                           tax determination process considers the default result defined for

                        that the process needs to evaluate in order to arrive at a specific

                        <p>Use these guidelines and examples to help
                           plan your tax rules implementation:

                                 rule results always equal the default values, then you don't need
                                 a tax rule. You only need to define a tax rule for a result that is
                                 different from the default value. For example, if more than one tax
                                 rate is possible for a given tax and tax status, then you need to
                                 create at least one tax rule.

                                    <p>If you require many different results
                                       other than the default value for a given tax and rule type, it probably
                                       means that the default value itself sometimes applies. In these cases,
                                       you should also define a tax rule for the default value. Otherwise
                                       the tax determination process must always process and eliminate the
                                       tax rules defined for all other values before arriving at the default.

                                    <p>As an alternative to defining a tax
                                       rule for the default value, you can assign the least frequent result
                                       as the default value. The tax determination process processes the
                                       maximum number of tax rules on the minimum number of occasions. In
                                       this kind of an implementation, you must ensure that your tax rules
                                       and conditions cover all of the more common results in order to prevent
                                       the tax determination process from using an incorrect result as a
                                       default.

                              <p>If you define multiple tax rules
                                 to derive distinct results for a process, assign the least frequent
                                 result as the default value for the process. The most frequent value
                                 should be the first tax rule. There are occasions for the default
                                 to be the most frequent value so you may want to define tax rules
                                 for exceptions, such as by item. In general, define tax rules for
                                 exceptions, but if there are a lot of tax rules that you need to define,
                                 then you may want to define a tax rule for the most common scenario
                                 to avoid processing all of the exceptions.

                              <p>When you define tax rules consider
                                 the need to repeat tax conditions in multiple rule types if the condition
                                 is part of the applicability evaluation. For example, if you define
                                 a Determine Tax Applicability rule for UK VAT that only applies when
                                 ship to is equal to United Kingdom, then you do not need to repeat
                                 this condition in a tax rule for a subsequent tax determination process,
                                 such as a Determine Tax Status rule.

                              <p>Where possible, use the tax rule
                                 header information instead of creating tax conditions that arrive
                                 at the same result. For example, if tax rules apply to the Purchase
                                 business process, set the tax event class to <span class="uicontrol">Purchase transaction</span> rather than defining a tax condition
                                 within the tax rule, such as tax event class is equal to Purchase
                                 transaction.
                              </p>

                              <p>When you order the tax condition
                                 sets within a tax rule, assign the higher priority to the set of conditions
                                 that occurs more frequently.  Similarly, when you order the tax rules
                                 within a rule type and tax, assign the higher priority to the tax
                                 rule that gives the most frequently arrived at process result.

                              <p>Use product tax exceptions for special
                                 rates based on product fiscal classifications rather than defining
                                 a Determine Tax Rate rule based on product fiscal classifications.
                                 For example, if three out of five product fiscal classifications use
                                 a special rate, define three product tax exceptions based on the three
                                 product fiscal classifications that need a special rate, and set the
                                 standard rate as the default rate.

                              <p>Define the minimum number of tax
                                 conditions necessary for a tax rule. For example, if a special rate
                                 applies to goods shipped outside a state as opposed to within a state,
                                 define one tax condition as ship from state isn't equal to ship to
                                 state, rather than defining two separate tax conditions for each ship
                                 from and ship to location, such as ship from state is equal to Nevada
                                 and ship to state is not equal to Nevada.

                              <p>Consider using the existing determining
                                 factor sets during the creation process. Any determining factor not
                                 set as required in the determining factor set definition can be set
                                 to ignore in the condition set. You don't have to define the condition
                                 and it is not evaluated. This allows flexibility in the condition
                                 set definition not requiring a unique determining factor set for every
                                 variation in condition set logic.

                                 to and from a tax zone, for example the European Union. Define a tax
                                 condition for all ship to countries within the tax zone rather than
                                 separate tax conditions for each country, such as ship to is equal
                                 to Great Britain, ship to is equal to France, and so on.

                              <p>For tax rules that apply to a specific
                                 geographic area, define tax rules with the additional context of the
                                 geographic area rather than adding location-based equal to tax conditions.
                                 For example, consider that you have a tax rule that only applies if
                                 the ship to state is California. In that case, you must define the
                                 tax rule such that it's only evaluated when the ship to state is California.
                                 You can do this by associating geography during the first step of
                                 the tax rule definition at the tax rule header level.

                           Always look for the most generic approaches that cover
                           more of the business requirements in a single tax rule. For example,
                           here the tax event class is used instead of a specific event class
                           for Payables transactions and another similar rule for Purchasing
                           transactions.
                           
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>It is determining factors like this that allows you
                           to define tax rules that are only applicable to specific types of
                           transactions. The previous approach allows you a convenient way of
                           splitting order-to-cash and procure-to-pay transactions. By using
                           event class you can make a more detailed refinement so that tax rules
                           are only applicable to specific product transactions. This flexibility
                           drives the simplification of combining procure-to-pay tax setup with
                           order-to-cash tax setup into a single model. In the majority of cases
                           you do not need to distinguish between procure-to-pay or order-to-cash
                           transactions within the tax rules, however, where there is a need
                           create specific procure-to-pay or order-to-cash tax rules using this
                           key design concept.

                           are several ways of modeling this but the approach that is recommended
                           for you to take is to use a registration status on the tax registration
                           record set up for the GB tax regime. It is also recommended that a
                           business process is in place and documentary evidence retained to
                           show that the supplier is validated as a true supplier registered
                           in another EU country. Until you complete this manual business process
                           the supplier should not be marked with the registration status of
                           registered in another EU country.

                           Always look for approaches which coupled with business

                           that you devise and implement a business procedure to ensure that
                           sufficient level of checking is done before the supplier or supplier
                           site tax registration record is created and that the correct registration
                           status entered. This business procedure ensures that the supplier
                           is a valid supplier and that their tax registration number is a valid
                           tax registration number.

                           this is to use a product fiscal classification which can automatically
                           be derived from the item defined on the transaction. However, in this
                           case if an item is not specified on the transaction, for example in
                           an unmatched purchase invoice being processed, then there is no product
                           fiscal classification derived. You need to create additional tax rules
                           and setup to address this situation.

                           Geography and tax zones are powerful features of Oracle

                           geography information into concepts such as tax rates. For example,

                           than creating specific tax regimes, taxes, tax statuses, and tax rates.

                           factors discussed previously are brought together as the basis for
                           the Tax Registration tax rule which identified that the bill-to party
                           registration be used in preference to the normal default bill-from
                           party registration. It is this bill-from party registration that triggers
                           the reverse charge (self-assessment) for the type of transaction.

                        <p>Tax legislation phrase 6 indicates how the determining
                           factors discussed previously are brought together as the basis for
                           the Place of Supply tax rule. This tax rule changes the normal place
                           of supply to be the ship-to location, which in the context of this
                           setup means that at least for the reverse charge (self-assessment)
                           side of this transaction it is deemed to have occurred in the UK.

                     <p>Tax rules, such as the Determine Tax Applicability
                        rule excludes certain categories of transactions from taxation. Such
                        transactions don't appear on many tax reports as they don't have any
                        tax lines.

                        on the party tax profile of the customer. This results in the creation
                        of a tax line with modified tax rate. You can use tax exemptions where
                        certificates of exemptions are issued for specific customers, which
                        is typical in tax regimes for US Sales and Use Tax.

                        <p>For example, the place of supply for UK VAT on goods
                           is generally the ship-from country. Thus, the place of supply of a
                           sale or purchase within the UK is the UK itself. However, if a UK
                           legal entity supplies goods from its French warehouse to a German
                           customer, then the place of supply will not find a jurisdiction for
                           UK VAT in France, and therefore UK VAT doesn't apply.

                           <p>Use place of supply rules to determine the place where
                              the transaction is deemed to have taken place when this determination
                              is based on certain criteria.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>For example, consider a German company supplying physical
                              services, such as work on goods at a customer's site in the UK, where
                              the customer is registered for UK VAT. With a default value of <span class="uicontrol">Ship to</span> for place of supply, the customer's
                              tax registration number is used on the transaction.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>Next, consider the same German company supplying physical
                              services at a customer's site in the UK, where the customer is not
                              registered for UK VAT. The default value of <span class="uicontrol">Ship to</span> for place of supply yields no tax registration
                              number since the customer isn't registered for UK VAT. In this case,
                              you create a place of supply rule to deem the <span class="uicontrol">Ship from</span> as the place of supply when the customer isn't
                              registered.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p>At transaction time the application derives the place
                              of supply from the transaction as shown in the table below. It is
                              important to consider how place of supply translates for the event
                              classes being considered for tax calculation in a regime since this
                              can include and exclude candidate taxes.

                              rules and account based direct rate rules determine tax applicability,
                              tax status, and tax rate without evaluating applicability rules and
                              defaults.

                              successfully, then the tax is applicable and the tax status and tax
                              rate defined for the rule are used in tax determination. If a direct
                              tax rate determination rule isn't evaluated successfully, then the
                              tax determination process resumes with the tax applicability rules.

                           area. You can also use tax zones to create parent tax regimes that
                           represent a related grouping of geographic regions for tax reporting
                           purposes. Use tax zones with tax rules, to create tax rules that refer
                           to a specific geographic location. The use of tax zones is optional

                           (FNGST) is a tax that all participating Aboriginal governments apply

                           settlement lands. The Aboriginal governments administer the 5 percent
                           FNGST in exactly the same way as the federal government administers
                           the Goods and Services Tax (GST). However, where FNGST applies, GST
                           doesn't apply.

                                 a party fiscal classification for First Nation, and associate the
                                 tax regimes affected by this tax. Associate CA FNGST to trigger applicability.
                                 Associate CA GST AND HST to avoid applicability when CA FNGST applies.

                                 with the specific party. To do so, create or edit an existing third-party
                                 tax profile and associate it with the First Nation party fiscal classification.

                                 classification of the ship-to party corresponds to the First Nation

                        <p>FNGST, a tax that is not applicable by default, becomes
                           applicable on transactions to First Nation parties. The first Determine
                           Tax Applicability rule makes FNGST applicable. This happens only when
                           the ship-to party on the transaction corresponds to the party fiscal
                           classification that identifies a First Nation party. Since GST doesn't
                           apply when FNGST is applicable, the second Determine Tax Applicability
                           rule has the opposite result. GST isn't applicable when the ship-to
                           party on the transaction is a First Nation party.

                           calculation is that of a Receivables credit memo that references an
                           invoice. In Receivables there can be standalone credit memos that
                           drive tax calculation based on the tax attributes entered on the credit
                           memo and there are applied credit memos that drive tax calculation
                           based on the referenced document; the invoice. If there is a credit
                           memo that isn't calculating what you expected in Receivables, you

                        <p>Level 1 precedes all other levels; the default precedence
                           is used only when the other levels aren't populated. When the rounding
                           level is blank, no attribute is set for that level.
                        </p>
                        <p>In this example, when the bill-from party tax profile
                           rounding level of Header is incorrect, you can identify the bill-from
                           party from the Tax Line Details header information and query the appropriate
                           party tax profile to modify the setup.
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a simple example which uses header level
                           for rounding. For rounding at Line level, you need to derive party
                           type for the Determine Tax Registration rule.
