                        <p>The first step is to determine the first party for
                           the transaction. It is usually the first-party legal entity for the
                           transaction, but can also be a business unit. The first-party legal
                           entity generally subscribes to several tax regimes of which some may
                           apply to the transaction. The tax regimes applicable depend on the
                           configuration owner tax options created for the first party and the
                           transaction event class. You assign a regime determination template
                           to the tax option, which lists the tax locations for the transactions.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Of the tax regimes to which the first party subscribes,
                           the tax determination process selects those with countries matching
                           the countries assigned to the relevant transaction location. The tax
                           determination process considers all taxes for these tax regimes that
                           are enabled and effective as of the transaction date as candidates
                           for further evaluation.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For the candidate tax, if the default value for tax
                           applicability is set to <span class="uicontrol">Applicable</span>, then it is considered to be applicable.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For each applicable tax, the tax determination process
                           determines the location type assigned for the default place of supply
                           and the geography type. The tax determination process determines the
                           transaction location address for the location type. The relevant information
                           on the address is the geography value for the geography type assigned
                           to the tax. For the tax, the tax determination process determines
                           if a tax jurisdiction is defined for the geography value. If there
                           is one, then the tax and the relevant tax jurisdiction is applicable
                           to the transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For each applicable tax, a valid tax registration
                           that is used for reporting is determined. The tax determination process
                           determines this based on the party type assigned to the default tax
                           registration for the tax. For this party on the transaction, determine
                           the most specific tax registration for tax regime, tax, and tax jurisdiction
                           combination, effective as of the transaction date. The tax and tax
                           jurisdiction are optional for defining registrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>For the tax, the tax determination process selects
                           the tax status that has default effectivity as of the transaction
                           date. For this tax status, the default tax rate that's applicable
                           as of the transaction date is determined. You can optionally define
                           tax rates for tax jurisdictions. You usually define these for state,
                           provincial, and city taxes where tax rates vary by the tax jurisdiction.
                           If there is a tax rate defined then this takes precedence over the
                           default tax rate defined for the tax status. If applicable, the tax
                           rate is then modified by any exception rate or tax exemption that
                           applies.

                           on a taxable basis. The default taxable basis formula assigned to
                           the tax is used for tax calculation. This is usually the line amount.
                           However, the formula can include other elements that alter the taxable
                           basis.

                           rate assigned to the transaction. The tax determination process applies
                           the recovery rate on the tax amount (calculated in the tax calculation
                           step) to determine recoverable and nonrecoverable tax amounts.

                     <p>Taxes are levied on transactions as per the
                        legislations in a country or region. They are seldom uniformly applied
                        on all transactions and tax legislation may seek differential levy,
                        treatment, and administration of taxes based on various transaction
                        attributes. Configure Oracle Fusion Tax to evaluate transactions based
                        on transaction attributes. The transaction attributes determine which
                        taxes apply to a transaction and how to calculate tax amount for each
                        tax that applies to the transaction.

                     <p>The tax determination process utilizes the tax foundation
                        configuration in conjunction with configuration options and tax rules
                        to process transactions for tax applicability and calculation. Tax
                        configuration ranges from simple models to complex models. Simple
                        models make use of default values without extensive processing while
                        complex models consider each tax requirement related to a transaction
                        before making the final calculation.

                     <p>When setting up a tax, examine the regulations that
                        govern the determination of the tax amount, from identifying applicability
                        drivers to how the tax is calculated. Organize the regulations into
                        one or more rule types for each tax. When the regulations indicate
                        that more than one result is possible for a given rule type, you need
                        to define rules within that rule type. Otherwise you can defer to
                        a default value for that rule type associated to the tax.

                              in certain countries require a complex logic to determine the applicable
                              taxes and rates on a transaction. Both tax applicability and tax rates
                              can vary. For example, by place of origin and place of destination,
                              party registration, status, service, or a combination of factors.
                              In some cases, the taxable amount of one tax may depend upon the amount
                              of another tax on the same transaction. And in rare cases, the tax
                              amount itself may depend on the tax amount of another tax. For all
                              of these and similar situations, you set up tax rules to define the
                              logic necessary to identify each step of the tax determination process.

                        <p>The tax determination process evaluates transaction
                           header and line information to derive tax lines for taxes applicable
                           to the transactions. The first step of the determination process is
                           to identify the first party of the transaction. The tax determination
                           process looks to the business unit on the transaction. The process
                           identifies whether its pointing to the configuration owner of the
                           business unit or legal entity depending on the <span class="uicontrol">Use subscription of the legal entity</span> option. The option
                           is on the party tax profile definition of the business unit. The tax
                           determination process determines if there are configuration owner
                           tax options associated with this party or if the predefined event
                           class option should be used.

                           or another regime determination set that is user-defined. TAXREGIME
                           or user-defined regime determination sets derive the applicable tax
                           regimes or tax regime through country or zone of the location. The
                           country or zone of the location is identified in the processing of
                           the regime determination determining factor set location values. STCC
                           determination is typically used for purposes of migrated data and
                           has a different processing logic driven by tax classification code.

                        <p>Tax regimes are considered based on geography and

                           then place of supply is processed for this transaction tax. If successful
                           the tax is applicable and the tax status and tax rate defined for
                           the direct rate rule are used in the tax calculation. If a direct
                           rate rule does not evaluate to true for this tax regime, configuration
                           owner, and tax the tax applicability rules are processed next. After
                           a tax is found applicable based on an applicability rule or a default
                           value the process verifies the place of supply and associated tax
                           jurisdiction. This is required except in the cases of migrated taxes.

                        <p>The place of supply process identifies the applicable
                           location type and associated tax jurisdiction where the supply of
                           goods or services is deemed to have taken place for a specific tax.
                           If the tax determination process cannot find a tax jurisdiction for
                           the location that corresponds to the place of supply location type,
                           the tax doesn't apply. It is removed as a candidate tax for the transaction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For example, the place of supply for UK value-added tax (VAT) on goods is generally the ship-from country. Thus, the place of
                           supply of a sale or purchase within the UK is the UK itself. However,
                           if a UK legal entity supplies goods from its French warehouse to a
                           German customer, then the place of supply will not find a jurisdiction
                           for UK VAT in France, and therefore UK VAT doesn't apply.

                        <p>Determine Tax Registration</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the party whose tax registration
                           is used for each tax on the transaction, and, if available, derives
                           the tax registration number.

                        <p>Determine Tax Status</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the tax status of each applicable
                           tax on the transaction. If the process cannot find a tax status for
                           an applicable tax, then Tax raises an error.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Determine Tax Rate</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the tax rate code for each
                           tax and tax status derived from the previous process. First the application
                           looks for a rate based on rate code and tax jurisdiction. If this
                           isn't found then the application looks for a rate with no tax jurisdiction.
                           If applicable, the tax rate is then modified by any exception rate
                           or tax exemption that applies. The result of this process is a tax
                           rate code and tax rate for each applicable tax.

                        <p>Determine Taxable Basis</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the taxable base for each
                           tax rate code. Depending on the tax rate type the taxable basis is
                           amount based or quantity based. The tax determination process typically
                           determines the tax by applying the tax rate to the taxable base amount.
                           In some cases, the taxable basis either can include another tax or
                           is based on the tax amount of another tax. Define taxable basis formulas
                           to manage these requirements.

                        <p>Determine Tax Calculation</p>
                        
                        <p>This process calculates the tax amount on the transaction.
                           In most cases, the tax amount is computed by applying the derived
                           tax rate to the derived taxable basis. In some exceptional cases,
                           the tax amount is altered by adding or subtracting another tax. Define
                           tax calculation formulas to manage these requirements.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Determine Tax Recovery</p>
                        
                        <p>This process determines the recovery rate to use
                           on procure-to-pay transactions when the tax allows for full or partial
                           recovery of the tax amount. For example, for UK manufacturing companies
                           VAT on normal purchases used for company business is 100% recoverable.
                           However, if you are a financial institution which only makes VAT exempt
                           on sales then you aren't allowed to recover any taxes and your recovery
                           rate is zero percent on all purchases. The recovery process impacts
                           the distribution level, tax amounts, and inclusiveness of taxes. The
                           resulting distribution amounts are adjusted as a result of the recovery
                           process. The recovery type is defined on the tax and identifies whether
                           there are one or two recovery types; primary and secondary. For each
                           tax and recovery type the application determines the recovery rate
                           based on a tax rule or default value defined on the tax.

                        <p>A tax exception must belong to a combination of tax
                           regime, configuration owner, and tax. You can also assign tax exceptions
                           to a tax status or tax rate belonging to the tax or to a tax jurisdiction.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>You can define Oracle Fusion Inventory organization
                           tax exceptions for items, or you can define tax exceptions for Inventory-based
                           product fiscal classifications or noninventory-based product categories.
                           If you are using Inventory-based product fiscal classifications then
                           generally, the application classifies the transaction line based on
                           the item. If you are using noninventory-based product category fiscal
                           classifications, you enter the appropriate product category on all
                           applicable lines to influence the tax result.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p> Product categories and product fiscal classifications
                           are defined in a hierarchical structure. It is important that you
                           select the appropriate level where the tax exception is applicable.
                           For product fiscal classifications to be used in item exceptions,
                           you must indicate that it is used in item exceptions at the tax regime
                           association to the product fiscal classification. You can set up only
                           one product fiscal classification for any specific tax regime with
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Used in Item Exceptions</span> option

                           legal entities and business units, you can set a separate configuration
                           option for the owning and sharing of product tax exceptions for a
                           combination of party and tax regime.

                           tax rate is what is evaluated during tax rate determination.

                        <p> At transaction time, the tax exception is used if
                           the details of the transaction and the tax match all of the entities
                           assigned to the tax exception. Only one tax exception can apply to
                           a transaction line for a specific tax.

                        <p>The tax determination process determines tax applicability,
                           tax status, and the tax rate for the transaction line. If tax exceptions
                           are allowed, the application looks at the item entered on the transaction
                           line to determine if an exception is defined at the tax, tax status,
                           tax rate, tax jurisdiction, Inventory organization, or Inventory level
                           and uses the exception at the most specific level.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If the application doesn't find any tax exception for
                           the item, it looks for a product fiscal classification associated
                           with the transaction line. If one exists, the application determines
                           if an exception is defined at the tax, tax status, tax rate, tax jurisdiction,
                           and product fiscal classification level and uses the exception at
                           the most specific level with the highest precedence.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>The tax rate is then based on the exception type and
                           calculated as follows:

                              <p>Discount: A reduction of the base tax
                                 rate. For example, if the discount is 15% off the standard rate and
                                 the standard rate is 10%, then the discount rate is 85% of the original
                                 10%, or 8.5%.

                                 tax rate. For example, if the surcharge is 10% and the standard rate
                                 is 10%, then the surcharge rate is 110% of the original 10%, or 11%.

                              <p>Special Rate: A rate that replaces
                                 the base tax rate. For example, if the special rate is 5% and the
                                 standard rate is 10%, the tax rate is the special rate of 5%.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                        <p>Finally, the new tax rate is applied to the taxable
                           basis and the tax amount is calculated.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>For manual tax lines, no additional processing is
                           performed and exceptions aren't considered. A manual tax lines suggests
                           that you have specific business requirements for a particular transaction
                           to apply a manual tax. No additional processing is performed for manual
                           tax lines to avoid any applying conflicting or inconsistent values
                           to the user-entered tax line. The tax calculation on a manual tax
                           line is the standard formula of: tax amount is equal to the taxable
                           basis multiplied by the tax rate.

                           point basis at tax rate to meet specific needs. When these exceptions
                           are configured, then the tax calculation process considers the following

                        Oracle Fusion Tax provides tax calculation for Payables event classes

                        them as necessary. Taxes are calculated automatically on validation

                        <p>Oracle Fusion Purchasing integrates with Oracle Fusion
                           Tax to automatically determine the applicable taxes on a purchase
                           order. You provide key tax-related information, known as tax determinants,
                           on the purchase order header and lines. Oracle Fusion  Tax uses this
                           information, along with other transaction information and defined
                           tax setup, and calculates the taxes that are applicable on the purchase
                           order.
                        </p>
                        <p>Taxes are calculated on a purchase order in view-only,
                           for example, you cannot directly update or override any tax details.
                           However, you can modify the tax determinants on the purchase order
                           so that the taxes are recalculated based on the revised information.
                        </p>
                        <p>Taxes are also calculated on a purchase requisition
                           in a quote mode. The calculated taxes are available for reference
                           purpose only. The nonrecoverable portion of the total calculated tax
                           amount applicable on a requisition is displayed as part of the requisition
                           approval amount. When you create a purchase order from a requisition,
                           the tax determinants available on the requisition are copied to the
                           purchase order and the taxes are recalculated based on the tax setup
                           available as of the date of the purchase order.
                        </p>
                        <p>When you create an invoice in Payables by matching
                           it to a purchase order, the purchase order tax lines and tax-related
                           information is copied to the invoice and tax is recalculated. The
                           tax rate that is used in tax calculation is always derived from the
                           invoice date.
                        </p>
                        <p>If the tax rate has not changed between the purchase
                           order date and the invoice date, then the tax calculation results
                           in the same tax lines on the invoice as on the purchase order shipment
                           line. If the tax rate has changed between the purchase order date
                           and the invoice date, then the tax calculation results in the same
                           tax lines (but the tax rate used corresponds to the invoice date).
                        </p>
                        <p>While creating the distributions on the invoice, Oracle
                           Fusion Tax compares the taxes applicable on the invoice to the taxes
                           calculated on the purchase order and generates variances for the difference
                           between the two. The possible deviations in the taxes between the
                           invoice and purchase order can be due to:
                        </p>
                        <ol>

                              <p>Tax applies to the purchase order but
                                 not to the invoice: The tax line appears on the invoice with a zero
                                 amount. The tax distribution displays two tax lines, one with a positive
                                 amount and the other with same negative amount.
                              </p>

                              <p>Tax applies to both the purchase order
                                 and the invoice but with different amounts: The tax line appears with
                                 the tax amount as calculated by the invoice. The tax distribution
                                 displays two tax lines, one line with the tax amount equal to the
                                 purchase order tax amount and one line with the tax amount equal to
                                 the difference between the purchase order tax amount and the invoice
                                 tax amount.
                              </p>
                              <p>The difference in the tax amounts between
                                 a purchase order and the invoice matched can be caused by changes
                                 in the invoice price, changes in the applicable tax rates, or changes
                                 in the exchange rates (in case of foreign currency invoices). Different

                        <p>When you apply a prepayment to an invoice, the tax
                           rate at the time of prepayment may differ from the tax rate at the
                           time that the prepayment is applied to an invoice. Oracle Fusion Tax
                           considers the tax calculated on the prepayment according to the value
                           assigned to the <span class="uicontrol">Applied Amount Handling</span> option in the tax record. The values are <span class="uicontrol">Recalculated</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Prorated</span>.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, you apply a prepayment amount of 5,000
                           USD to an invoice with a total amount of 10,000 USD. At the time of
                           prepayment, the applicable tax rate was 5% (250 USD tax on the prepayment);
                           at the time of invoice creation, the applicable tax rate is 10%. Tax
                           is calculated in this way:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                           
                           <li>
                              <p>Recalculated: The tax is recalculated
                                 on the prepayment using the invoice tax rate and the same tax rate
                                 is applied to the invoice line amount. The tax calculation creates
                                 two tax lines: one for the invoice line amount and one for the prepayment
                                 with a negative amount. In the invoice example, the calculation creates
                                 an invoice line amount tax line of 1,000 USD (10% * 10,000 USD) and
                                 a prepayment tax line of -500 USD (10% * -5000 USD). This reverses
                                 tax calculated on the invoice for the prepayment amount applied. The
                                 tax calculated on the prepayment is retained.
                              </p>
                           </li>

                              <p>Prorated: The tax calculated on the
                                 prepayment is reversed and the tax rate applied to the invoice line
                                 is retained. The tax calculation creates two tax lines: one for the
                                 invoice line amount and one for the prepayment with a negative amount.
                                 In the invoice example, the calculation creates an invoice line amount
                                 tax line of 1,000 USD (10% * 10,000 USD) and a prepayment tax line
                                 of -250 USD (5% * -5000 USD). The total tax is 750 USD.

                        <p>In Payables, you can create a new invoice to correct
                           the quantity or amount of an existing invoice. The correction results
                           in a change in the line amount, either positive or negative. Tax is
                           calculated on the new invoice created as a result of the price correction
                           in proportion to the taxes on the original corrected invoice. For
                           example, an original invoice has a line amount of 100 USD and two
                           tax lines: 5 USD and 10 USD. If the price correction reduces the line
                           amount by 20 USD, then the new invoice creates two tax lines: -1 USD
                           and -2 USD.

                           In many countries you must record the value that appears
                           on the invoice or reject the invoice. Ask for a new invoice with the
                           correct amount and a credit for the original invoice amount if you
                           have already paid it.

                     <div class="sect3" id="FAUTX12615"><h4 class="OracleScenario">Self-Assessed Tax Lines</h4>
                        <p>Where a tax was not levied by the supplier, but is
                           deemed as due by the purchaser, you can self-assess the taxes calculated
                           on the invoices that you receive. When self-assessment applies to
                           an invoice no transaction line is created for the tax since the self-assessed
                           tax is not included in the invoice total. However, when you access
                           the detail tax lines region you see the self-assessed tax calculated.
                           In addition, offsetting distributions are created in the Payables
                           subledger to negate the self-assessed tax impact as an open invoice
                           balance. You can also self assess taxes using offset taxes and reporting
                           only taxes. An offset tax record is a matching, duplicate record with
                           negative amounts that reduces or completely offsets the tax liability
                           recorded in the tax transactions. Reporting only taxes do not create
                           invoice distributions, but you can use them to capture additional
                           tax information on transactions for your tax reports.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example using self-assessed taxes, you enter an
                           invoice from a supplier for 1000 USD. The supplier did not charge
                           tax on the invoice, however, according to tax rules, as the purchaser
                           you are liable to pay a 5% tax on the item to your tax authority.
                           The self-assessed tax amount is 50 USD. Provided the tax setup allows
                           self-assessed taxes, 50 USD is applied to the invoice as a self-assessed
                           tax amount. The amount of the self-assessed tax does not impact the
                           amount due to the supplier. With regard to self-assessed taxes, the
                           accounting debit entry in the Payables subledger captures the self-assessed
                           tax expense, and the corresponding accounting credit entry in the
                           Payables subledger captures the self-assessed tax liability.

                     <p>A recoverable tax allows full or partial recovery
                        of taxes paid on purchases, either as a recoverable payment or as
                        a balance against taxes owed. A tax recovery rate identifies the percentage
                        of recovery for a tax designated by the tax authority for a specific
                        transaction line. You can review Oracle Fusion Payables tax distributions
                        and, if applicable, update the tax recovery rate on a tax distribution
                        depending on your tax setup and security access. The component in
                        Oracle Fusion Purchasing is view-only.

                                 intended to offset each other, they are created for the same amount,
                                 but one with a positive value and the other with a negative value.

                        <p>In most tax regimes, a tax that is paid by a registered
                           establishment can claim back 100% of taxes due from the tax authority,
                           except for specific designated purchases. Depending upon the details
                           of a company's business purchases and tax authority regulations, a
                           number of exception regulations may accompany the details of tax recovery.
                           Tax implications are:

                                 books to be sold in stores is 100% recoverable. Therefore, 1,300 CAD
                                 is recoverable (10,000 CAD * 13%).

                                 Therefore, 650 CAD is nonrecoverable (5,000 CAD * 13%).

                        <p>The HST tax configuration specifies that the recovery
                           tax rate for zero 0% recoverable is used as a default. A tax rule
                           is defined to apply a 100% recoverable rate for products with an intended
                           use of Resale.

                     <p>You can override taxes calculated on a transaction
                        depending on the controls you configure within the tax setup. You
                        can place certain restrictions on the maximum override amount for
                        a Payables event class transaction belonging to a configuration owner. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Define these tolerances at the configuration owner
                        tax options level and specify the maximum tax override amount or the
                        maximum allowed percentage deviation between the originally calculated
                        tax amount and the overridden amount.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>When you override the automatically calculated taxes
                        on a transaction and if the variance between them exceeds the specified
                        tolerance limits, the Oracle Fusion Payables invoice is placed on
                        hold. The logic for placing the invoice on hold evaluates the overridden
                        amount compared against both the tax tolerance percentage and the
                        tax tolerance amount and the lower of the two values is considered.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>For example, if you define the tolerances as maximum
                        allowed amount 15 USD and the maximum allowed percentage 10%, then
                        the application of invoice hold based on the tax override tolerances
                        is as follows. All dollars are in USD currency.

                     <p>The tax control amount is one of the key tax
                        determinants available on the invoice header and lines that influences
                        the calculated tax amount. Use the tax control amount to match the
                        total calculated tax amount on the invoice with the tax amount given
                        on the supplier invoice. Oracle Fusion Tax adjusts the calculated
                        taxes based on the specified tax control amount in proportion to the
                        tax amounts determined for the applicable taxes.

                     <p>For example, you have an invoice with two item lines,
                        and taxes are applicable on both lines. All amounts are reflected
                        in USD currency.

                        <p>In this scenario, the line level total tax amounts
                           are first adjusted in the proportion to their calculated tax amounts.
                           For example, line 1 tax amount total is 400 USD which equates to 66.667%
                           of the total tax amount (400/600 = 66.667%). The individual taxes
                           for a line are then aligned with the line total amount in proportion
                           to the calculated taxes. For example, line 1 adjusted tax amount is
                           the header control amount of 400 USD multiplied by 66.667% (400 *
                           66.667% = 266.67).
                        </p>
                        <p>Similarly, line 2 adjusted tax amount is 133.33 USD.
                           The individual taxes involved are further apportioned in the ratio
                           of their earlier tax amounts, for example, 75% and 25% (150/200 and
                           50/200, respectively).

                           tax amount for Tax-A is the line 2 control amount of 100 USD multiplied
                           by 150/200 (100 * 75% = 75).

                           amounts are then further influenced by the option <span class="uicontrol">Allow recalculation of manual tax lines</span> set.
                           You can find the option at the configuration owner tax options level.

                           tax amounts. For example, line 2 adjusted tax amount for Tax-A is
                           the line 2 control amount of 100 USD less the manual tax amount of
                           20 USD multiplied by 150/200 ((100 - 20) * 75% = 60).

                           The invoice header control amount is 400 USD, the Line-2 control amount

                        <p>Receivables calculates taxes on both On Account credit
                           memos and Applied credit memos.

                        <p>Tax calculation for On Account credit memos is identical
                           to Receivables invoices. The only difference is that if your credit
                           memo lines are a negative amount, calculated tax amounts are also
                           negative.

                        <p>Create an Applied credit memo at the transaction header
                           level or at the transaction line level. At the header level, your

                              tax from lines</span> option. If this option is selected, you
                           can only enter a line credit percentage or a line amount. The tax
                           credit percentage is populated automatically, which is same as the
                           line credit percentage.

                                 amount are credited proportionately to each transaction line and tax
                                 line of the transaction.

                                 line of the transaction.

                           the PST tax regime. The tax was correct for line 1, but the tax for
                           line 2 should have been calculated at a reduced rate.

                           after the tax exception. Therefore, the 5% tax rate is modified by
                           a 2% discount (5% * (100%-2%) = 4.9%). If the tax exemption defined
                           is of the rate type of <span class="uicontrol">Special rate</span> then the special rate is substituted and the applicable tax exception
                           has no impact.

                        <p>For manual tax lines, no additional processing is
                           performed and tax exemptions are not considered. A manual tax line
                           suggests that you have specific business requirements for a particular
                           transaction to apply a manual tax. No additional processing is performed
                           for manual tax lines to avoid any applying conflicting or inconsistent
                           values to the user-entered tax line. The tax calculation on a manual
                           tax line is the standard formula of tax amount is equal to the taxable
                           basis multiplied by the tax rate.

                                 on the default tax rate code for the tax jurisdiction you entered.
                                 If you update tax rate, Oracle Fusion Tax recalculates the tax amount
                                 based on the new tax rate you entered.

                                 and notice the taxes are incorrect on the transaction, Oracle Fusion
                                 Receivables allows changing the transaction provided there's no activity.
                                 You can change the status on the transaction to incomplete and update
                                 the transaction header, transaction line, or tax line attributes.
                                 If your transaction has activity against it, the Incomplete button

                     <p>Your Receivables activity on the adjustment
                        determines if your adjustment is stored in the Oracle Fusion Tax repository.
                        Adjustments you create using the Receivables activity with the <span class="uicontrol">Recoverable</span> option not selected are only
                        stored in Oracle Fusion Receivables. The concept behind nonrecoverable
                        adjustments is that even though you adjust tax, you still pay the
                        calculated tax on your invoice to the tax authority. If you select
                        the <span class="uicontrol">Recoverable</span> option for your
                        Receivables activity, adjustments are also recorded in the Oracle
                        Fusion Tax repository, which is the foundation for tax reporting.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Only invoice adjustments, line adjustments, and tax
                        adjustments are stored in the Oracle Fusion Tax repository depending
                        upon the Receivables activity you entered on your adjustments.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The tax calculation for tax adjustments is similar
                        to header level tax only Applied credit memos. The adjusted tax amount
                        is proportionately adjusted to each tax line of the transaction.

                        in the same legal entity. Transactions occurring between two legal
                        entities are called intercompany transactions, and transactions occurring

                     <p>Oracle Fusion Tax allows you to calculate
                        taxes on the intercompany Oracle Fusion Receivables and Oracle Fusion
                        Payables transactions. You can use both standard tax classification
                        code and regime-based determination methods.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>In intercompany transactions, a Receivables transaction
                        is first generated and then the applicable taxes get calculated. The
                        Receivables transaction information, including the tax determinants,
                        is then populated into the Payables interface tables. While creating
                        and importing the Payables transaction from the interface tables,
                        you can validate the taxes calculated on the Receivables transaction
                        for their applicability on the Payables transaction. If applicable,
                        the application applies them to the Payables transaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p> If you use the regime-based tax determination method,
                        applicability for any additional taxes is also determined, with reference
                        to the available tax determinants and the tax rules configured in
                        the tax setup.

                              <p>When a Receivables transaction is
                                 generated through the intercompany process, the tax determinants appear
                                 as defaults. This is based on the information defined in the country
                                 defaults and the application tax options. Oracle Fusion Tax calculates
                                 the corresponding taxes accordingly. If you need to revise the taxes,

                        The tax accounts you define for tax serve as default accounting information
                        for tax rates and tax jurisdictions. You can override the defaulted
                        accounts. Configure the tax recoverable or liability account for the
                        tax recovery rate. Accounts assigned to the tax rate and recovery
                        rate are used when the taxes are applicable to the transaction.

                        available, tax accounts defined for the primary ledger are used. These

                        depend on the subledger accounting configuration.

                        is enabled for transactions, simulation, or both. During testing,
                        enable a tax for simulation to ensure the setup is correct. When setup
                        is complete and tested, enable the tax for actual transaction tax
                        processing.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>When you create a simulator transaction, you
                        can select which types of taxes to evaluate for applicability: taxes
                        enabled for simulation only, taxes enabled for transactions only,
                        or both.
