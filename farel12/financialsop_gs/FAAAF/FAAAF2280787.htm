                  <p>Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence is a real-time,
                     self-service solution that lets users create ad hoc analyses and dashboards
                     with real-time transactional data, using different Oracle BI technologies.

                           included as a component of a dashboard. Analyses are generally interactive,
                           allowing users to customize the presentation of the data in real time.

                        For end users installing the Oracle Fusion Financials
                        Reporting Studio, the installer starts a separate console window.
                        The installer continues to run for a brief time after the installation
                        completes the setup tasks. The process is normal, expected, and applies
                        to Oracle Reporting Studio installations in both the Oracle Fusion
                        Applications and Enterprise Performance Manager modes.
                        
                        <p>Wait for the console window to close, which happens
                           automatically, before clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span> button on the Financial Reporting Studio Installation dialog box.
                           If you click the <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span> button
                           before the console window closes, the Financial Reporting Studio installation
                           may not complete.

                        Ledger setup has to be completed before the database
                        connection can be created. General Ledger balances cubes are created
                        as part of ledger setup. A separate cube is created for each combination
                        of chart of accounts and accounting calendar. A database connection
                        is needed for each cube.

                        (BI), Accounting Segment Dimensions such as Balancing segment or Cost
                        Center segment are based on the Chart of Accounts configuration. These
                        segments can be configured to be tree-enabled, which means that hierarchies
                        are defined upon the segment values for rollup purposes. In such scenarios,
                        you must filter by a specific hierarchy when performing ad hoc queries
                        against tree-based accounting segments. Incorrect results may occur
                        if tree filters are not applied. To apply tree filters, create a filter
                        condition on Tree Filter attributes in Accounting Segment Dimensions.

                     <p>Requests submitted through Oracle Enterprise Scheduler
                        are processed by the Oracle BI Publisher scheduler. Requests submitted
                        through the Reports and Analytics pane can be either real-time online
                        requests or scheduled  requests. Requests submitted through an application

                     <p>Oracle BI Publisher is configured to accept requests
                        from Oracle Applications Cloud. However, before you can deliver report
                        documents to their destinations, you must define  the delivery servers
                        in Oracle BI Publisher. Use the Oracle BI Publisher Administration
                        page to define your delivery servers.

                     <p>Once delivery servers are defined, you can further
                        configure the number of report processor and delivery threads to best
                        handle your processing and delivery requirements. In addition, you
                        can configure report properties for the system  or at the report level
                        to tune performance of your reports. To diagnose report processing
                        issues, BI Publisher provides a set of scheduler diagnostics.
