                        <p>To use the integrated invoice imaging
                           solution, you must have a designated e-mail account to send the invoice
                           images. When you sign up for the Oracle Cloud Application Service,
                           you're provided with one.

                        <p>After you have the e-mail account,

                              <p>If your business process is to
                                 receive invoice images from your suppliers, communicate to them your
                                 imaging requirements. The suppliers can then e-mail the invoice images
                                 directly to the designated e-mail account.

                                 account.

                           The solution checks for new images every minute and creates invoices
                           from the images.

                           The incomplete invoices appear in the Scanned information tile on

                        receive images by e-mail. You can communicate imaging requirements
                        to your suppliers, such as to send images in the TIFF format with
                        a minimum of 300 dpi.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>For images sent by e-mail, imaging specialists can
                        check for quality and proper formatting. For paper invoices, imaging
                        specialists can sort the invoices into different categories based
                        on parameters, such as geography, invoice type, invoice amount, and
                        due date. They can then scan the invoices to convert them to images.

                     <p>Imaging specialists forward the images to the designated
                        e-mail account. They can optionally specify attributes in the e-mail
                        subject for the purposes of routing and recording.

                        the images from the designated e-mail account at scheduled intervals.

                     <p>The imaging solution sends the batches to
                        Oracle Forms Recognition for intelligent data recognition and extraction
                        of the invoice attributes.

                     <p>Forms Recognition offers cutting-edge intelligent
                        recognition capabilities for extracting the invoice attributes from
                        the scanned images. Unlike other solutions that use supplier-specific
                        templates to extract information, Forms Recognition can intelligently
                        locate data within the invoice. The data can be found regardless of
                        its location on the image and whether Forms Recognition has processed
                        invoices from that supplier before. As suppliers are added, or an
                        existing supplier changes its invoice layout, Forms Recognition can
                        extract the attributes from the new invoice layouts.

                     <p>Oracle WebCenter Imaging stores the invoice
                        images and extracted information. For the rest of the invoice life
                        cycle, any reference to the invoice image points to the imaging repository.
                        This ensures documents are never replicated further during invoice
                        processing.

                     <p>The imaging solution uses the extracted attributes
                        from the images to create the invoices. If exceptions occur during
                        processing, the invoices are marked as incomplete and routed to accounts
                        payable personnel using Oracle Business Process Execution Language
                        (BPEL) workflows. A default routing rule routes the incomplete invoices
                        to all users with the Accounts Payable Specialist and Accounts Payable
                        Supervisor job roles.

                        requiring attention are highlighted on the Edit Invoice page for quick
                        identification and resolution. With a dual monitor setup, you can
                        review both the invoice and the invoice image at the same time.

                        embedded within Oracle Fusion Payables. Accounts payable personnel
                        can review and annotate the images using the embedded image viewer.

                  <p>The integrated invoice imaging solution provides
                     for processing invoice images that are received by e-mail.
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The e-mail must be sent in a certain format and meet
                     specifications that are acceptable by Oracle Document Capture. Imaging
                     specialists must scan and convert the paper invoices received from
                     suppliers to images. Alternatively, if invoices have been received
                     as e-mail attachments, imaging specialists check for quality and proper
                     formatting.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>You can optionally enter attributes in the e-mail
                     subject for recording on the invoice and for routing if the invoices
                     are incomplete. A preconfigured routing rule is provided to route
                     incomplete invoices to all users with Accounts Payables Specialist
                     and Accounts Payable Supervisor job roles.

                  <p>Consider the following when receiving invoice images
                     through e-mail.

                     <p>As in the previous example, attributes can include
                        alphanumeric characters. The maximum length for each attribute depends
                        on how many attributes you're using. For example, if you use all five
                        attributes, the maximum length of each attribute is 34 characters.
                        You can modify the maximum length of each attribute to meet your requirements
                        however, the sum of the attribute values should not exceed the limit.
                        This limit is calculated as follows, assuming that all five attributes
                        are used and that the image is stored in the file location C:\OFR\Import\.

                              has an e-mail subject of <span class="uicontrol">Invoice 42366_30014001</span>, the business unit ID for that invoice is <span class="uicontrol">30014001</span>.
