                        multiple currencies, the report converts the invoice amounts to the
                        ledger currency.

                        are missing conversion rates, amounts won't appear on the report.

                     <p>You can use the Payables Matched and Modified
                        Receipts report to identify receipts that were changed after being
                        matched to an invoice. A receipt might be changed for example, to
                        correct the received quantity or record the return of a defective
                        product.

                     <p>The report displays receipts that were matched to
                        an invoice, credit memo, or debit memo, and modified within the specified
                        dates. If you match multiple invoices to a receipt before the modification
                        date, the report lists all of the matched distributions. If you match
                        one invoice to a receipt and:

                              the receipt line was modified, then all matched distributions are

                              are listed. The modified receipt quantities were seen when later matches
                              were performed and tolerances were checked during the invoice validation
                              process.

                        The IRS requires electronic filing if you submit 250 or more records
                        for your US 1099 reporting. You must report US 1099 information for
                        each tax reporting entity that you define for your organization. The
                        250 record requirement is applicable to each tax reporting entity.

                        K records for tax regions or states participating in the Combined
                        Filing Program that have qualifying payments. The report also produces
                        B records for suppliers with US 1099 payment amounts which equal or
                        exceed the tax region's reporting limit in qualifying states.

                     <h3>Setting Up for Payables to General Ledger Reconciliation: Points to Consider</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Periodically you reconcile the transactions
                        in your accounts payable application, both before and after you post
                        to the general ledger. The Payables to General Ledger Reconciliation
                        preparation process and report help simplify reconciliation and reduce
                        the amount of manual reconciling activity required.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The automated activities in the reconciliation process
                        function according to your Oracle Fusion Financials setup. A review
                        of some of these setups can help improve the overall reconciliation
                        process.

                           accounted amounts on the report summary should be the same. The Payables

                           Balance report for the last day of the previous period. The Payables
                           End Balance accounting amount should agree with the Payables Trial

                     <p>For example, you're closing the April accounting period
                        and you posted the final invoice and payment batches to the general
                        ledger. To reconcile accounts payable activity for April, perform
                        the following calculation: March Payables Trial Balance + April Payables
                        Posted Invoice Register - April Payables Posted Payment Register =
                        April Payables Trial Balance.

                        The Payables Trial Balance Report is based on information
                        stored in Payables and Oracle Fusion Subledger Accounting. To reconcile
                        with the balances stored in Oracle Fusion General Ledger, you must
                        use the Payables to General Ledger Reconciliation Report.

                        a single balancing organization.

                        a single balancing organization.

                        to revalue open items, accounting for changes in the value of liabilities
                        due to foreign currency rate changes. Open items include invoices,
                        prepayments, credit memos, and debit memos that are unpaid as of the
                        last date of the revaluation period you specify.

                        general ledger balance for the difference between the original and
                        revalued balances. The report calculates the difference for each liability
                        account with a total for each balancing segment. You should reverse
                        the general ledger entry at the beginning of the next period to synchronize payables
                        and general ledger balances.
