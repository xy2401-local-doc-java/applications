                           on parameters, such as geography, invoice type, invoice amount, and
                           due date. They can then scan the invoices to convert them to images.

                           the scanned images. Unlike other solutions that use supplier-specific
                           templates to extract information, Forms Recognition can intelligently
                           locate data within the invoice. The data can be found regardless of
                           its location on the image and whether Forms Recognition has processed
                           invoices from that supplier before. As suppliers are added, or an
                           existing supplier changes its invoice layout, Forms Recognition can
                           extract the attributes from the new invoice layouts.

                           alphanumeric characters. The maximum length for each attribute depends
                           on how many attributes you're using. For example, if you use all five
                           attributes, the maximum length of each attribute is 34 characters.
                           You can modify the maximum length of each attribute to meet your requirements
                           however, the sum of the attribute values should not exceed the limit.
                           This limit is calculated as follows, assuming that all five attributes
                           are used and that the image is stored in the file location C:\OFR\Import\.

                           of IF and THEN components. The IF component specifies the conditions
                           that determine when to apply the rule. The THEN component specifies
                           what happens when the conditions are met.

                           prepayment is a catering deposit to a hotel. When the invoice from
                           the hotel arrives, you can apply the prepayment to the invoice to
                           reduce the invoice amount due.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If you disable the <span class="uicontrol">Allow prepayment
                              application</span> option, you can't apply the prepayment and
                           the prepayment is classified as permanent. An example of a permanent
                           prepayment is a lease deposit for which you don't expect to receive
                           an invoice.

                        <p>When you apply a prepayment, the invoice is updated
                           to reflect the amount paid and the prepayment amount available for
                           application is reduced. A prepayment application line with corresponding
                           distributions is added to the invoice.
                        </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>Applied prepayments can be either inclusive or exclusive.
                           A supplier might send you an invoice that references a prepayment.
                           If the supplier reduces the invoice amount by the prepayment and associated
                           tax, the prepayment is inclusive. You can designate a prepayment as
                           inclusive by selecting the <span class="uicontrol">Included on Invoice</span> option when applying the prepayment. When you apply an exclusive
                           prepayment to an invoice, the unpaid invoice amount is reduced by
                           the amount of the prepayment application.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>If a prepayment is matched to a purchase order, purchase
                           order quantities are updated during prepayment application.
                        </p>

                           You can pay a prepayment in a currency that's different
                           from the invoice currency. To apply that prepayment to an invoice,
                           the invoice must have the same invoice currency as the invoice currency
                           of the prepayment.
                           
                           <p>For example, if you have the following payables documents:</p>

                                 <p>Prepayment: Invoice currency is
                                    USD, payment currency is RUB
                                 </p>

                           <p>You can apply the prepayment to the invoice because

                     <h3>Invoice Corrections: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>With corrections you can adjust invoices that
                        were matched to purchase order schedules, distributions, receipts,
                        or consumption advice documents. You can also adjust amounts of invoices
                        that weren't matched. The correction is the difference between the
                        original price, quantity, or amount, and the new price, quantity,
                        or amount. For example, if a supplier decreases the price by 10 USD,
                        the correction invoice is for -10 USD.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can perform price, quantity, and amount corrections. The purchase order line type determines what type of
                        correction you can make to a matched invoice. The purchase order line
                        type can be amount-based or quantity-based.
                     </p>

                        <p>A price correction adjusts the unit price
                           of an invoice that was matched to a purchase order, receipt, or consumption
                           advice. Price corrections don't adjust billed quantities on purchase
                           orders. To correct an invoice for a price decrease, you can create
                           a credit or debit memo. To correct an invoice for a price increase,
                           create a standard invoice.

                           In general, tax distributions are created automatically
                           when you validate an invoice. However, if your tax setup permits,
                           you can enter tax distributions manually.

                           withholding tax type invoice lines, updates the withheld amount on
                           the invoice, and updates the unpaid amount on the installment.

                        created with the same distribution combinations as the item lines
                        that you allocated them to. Allocation information is used to record
                        the full cost of an item if you use periodic costing in Oracle Fusion

                     <p>An installment is the part of the invoice
                        that specifies payment due dates, amounts, and other payment information.
                        An invoice can have one or more installments.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The payment terms and terms date on an invoice are
                        used to calculate payment due dates and amounts. For example, if an
                        invoice has payment terms of Net 30, the due date is 30 days after
                        the terms date.

                        <p>You can split an installment. For example, you split
                           an installment to make payments on two different days or to use two
                           different payment methods. When you split an installment, another
                           installment is automatically created for half of the gross amount
                           of the installment that you split. You can then edit the due and discount
                           dates and amounts on the new installment.

                           You can release some invoice holds manually without submitting the
                           validation process. For other invoice holds, you must correct the
                           exception by updating the invoice or purchase order, then resubmitting
                           the validation process to release the hold. You can also review and
                           adjust tolerance limits, if needed.

                     <p>An invoice has a matching hold because the billed
                        quantity exceeds the received quantity. For example, the billed quantity
                        is 6 and the received quantity is 5. The receiving department receives
                        the remaining goods and records the receipt. The quantity on the invoice
                        line now matches the receipt quantity. You resubmit the validation

                        price exceeds the purchase order schedule price. For example, the

                        is 9.00 USD. A supplier sends a credit to correct the amount due on
                        the previous invoice. You perform a price correction and
                        resubmit the validation process to release the hold.

                     <h3>Invoice Tolerances: Explained</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Invoice tolerances determine whether matching
                        holds are placed on invoices for variances between invoices and the
                        documents you match them to, such as purchase orders. When you run
                        the invoice validation process for a matched invoice, the process
                        checks that matching occurs within the defined tolerances. For example,
                        if the billed amount of an item exceeds a tolerance, a hold is placed
                        on the invoice. You can't pay the invoice until the hold is released.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p></p>
                     
                     <p>You can define tolerances based on quantity or amount.
                        For each type of tolerance, you can specify percentages or amounts.
                        Once you define the tolerances, assign them to a supplier site.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="infobox-note"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                        If you specify a percentage tolerance of zero, variance
                        isn't allowed. If you want a low tolerance, specify a small percentage.
                        If an active tolerance doesn't have a value, then infinite variance
                        is allowed.

                           the installment and placing one installment on hold. You can release
                           the installment hold after you receive the second desk.

                           system holds for exception conditions. For example, if the sum of

                           then validating the invoice to release the hold. For example, to resolve
                           a distribution variance hold, adjust the distribution amounts, and
                           then validate the invoice.

                     <p>Oracle B2B Server is an Oracle SOA Suite component
                        that manages interactions between trading partners, such as suppliers
                        and deploying companies. Trading partners can communicate electronically
                        by sending documents in XML format using B2B. B2B XML invoices use
                        the same XML standard developed by the Open Applications Group (OAG),
                        171_Process_Invoice_002 (version 7.2.1).

                           communications from the supplier and assigns a Site Code to the supplier
                           site that's sending the B2B invoices. In the invoice header of the
                           invoice payload, the supplier has to provide the B2B Site Code. The
                           B2B Site Code is populated in the <code>&lt;PARTNER&gt;&lt;PARTNRIDX&gt;</code> element, where <code>&lt;PARTNER&gt;&lt;PARTNRTYPE&gt;</code> = Supplier. The B2B Site Code is used to derive the internal supplier
                           ID and site ID used by the customer.

                        which prevents invoice accounting and payment.

                           receipts. After the received material is delivered to its final destination,

                           Receipt Accruals process. The process generates the accrual and creates
                           a reversing journal with an incomplete status. You must run the Create
                           Accrual Reversal Accounting process to change the journal status to
