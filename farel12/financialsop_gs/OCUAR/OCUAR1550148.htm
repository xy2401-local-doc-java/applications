                     <p>See if the analysis or dashboard already appears on your page,
                        maybe on a separate tab. Or there might be, for example, a link to
                        the report you want to use. Also look for the Reports and Analytics pane, which
                        may appear on your work
                        area as a panel
                        tab or in the regional area. In the pane, you find analytics and reports
                        specific to the work area you're on.

                     <p>To see all the analytics and reports that you have
                        access to, use the Reports and Analytics work area (<span><span class="uicontrol">Navigator</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Tools</span> - <span class="uicontrol">Reports and Analytics</span></span>).

                     <h3>Why do I see amounts of zero in analyses?</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>The currency exchange rates might not be
                        set up correctly. For example, you choose EUR as your preferred currency
                        in general preferences, and your corporate currency is USD. Amounts
                        in analyses are
                        displayed in EUR after conversion from USD, based on the current exchange
                        rate. But if the exchange rate between EUR and USD isn't set up, or
                        if the conversion fails for any reason, then the amounts show as zero.
                        If this happens, contact your help desk.
