                     and other users perform real-time transactional queries.

                     reporting platform that is built on top of an analytic data model.
                     The reports work off the same data source and support drill-downs
                     to real-time source transactions. The queries and reports are accurate
                     and up to the minute, providing multidimensional analysis without
                     the need for a separate data warehouse.

                  <p>Oracle Fusion Financial Applications embraces
                     the concept of dashboards to bring the work that needs to be done and the information needed
                     to do it to the front and center of each user's attention.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>All Oracle Fusion Financials applications deploy dashboards.
                     On a dashboard, work areas display tabulations of the tasks that a given role needs to accomplish.
                     These are updated by incoming work load in real time. In Payables,
                     for example, newly scanned invoices are tabulated for the Payables
                     Specialist to process. In General Ledger, the accounts monitored by
                     the accountant are updated at each journal posting. In Receivables,
                     new invoices and receipts pending further actions are listed for the
                     Billing Specialist and Receivables Specialist to process.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The tabulations are designed to be easily adjusted
                     to suit your needs in several ways and can be modified, prioritized,
                     and even replaced. Portlets to other Oracle and non-Oracle sources
                     can be added.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>The work areas monitor processes and provide updates
                     on status. Items awaiting approval, for example, are listed, as are
                     items with issues, such as incomplete invoices and unposted journals.
                     Social tools are available, so that any person who needs to act, such
                     as an approver, can be contacted immediately. The tabulations support
                     searching by example, saved searches, export to spreadsheet, and other
                     actions, so that the work can be moved along without using menus or
                     navigating away from the work area.
