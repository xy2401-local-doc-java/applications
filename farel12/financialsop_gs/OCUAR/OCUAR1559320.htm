                     <p>During the internal reconciliation process,
                        you use the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation Report to
                        confirm that transactional data and accounting data match. However,
                        even if the data matches, the journals could still post to incorrect
                        general ledger accounts, due to issues with your Receivables setup.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>Use the Potential Reconciling Items Report to help
                        you identify and correct these setup issues.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You typically run the Potential Reconciling Items
                        Report:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>

                              prior to running final accounting, in order to confirm the correct
                              derivation of accounting.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                           <p>Whenever the accounting setup has
                              been modified--such as the creation of new transaction types, receipt
                              methods or receivables activities--prior to running final accounting.
                           </p>
                           
                        </li>
                        
                     </ul>
                     
                     <p>The report suggests journal items that potentially
                        posted to general ledger accounts with unexpected account types, thus
                        creating reconciliation issues in general ledger. An unexpected account
                        type refers to general ledger account types that are not normally
                        associated with an item general ledger category. General ledger account
                        types used by Receivables include assets, liabilities, income, and
                        expense.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, a receivable item might be expected
                        to post to an asset account. If the item posts to a non-asset account,
                        then it will appear on the Potential Reconciling Items Report.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Typical items that the Potential Reconciling Items
                        Report includes are:

                     <p>Use the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation
                        report to facilitate the reconciliation of receivables data to the
                        general ledger.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The interactive reporting capability of the Receivables
                        to General Ledger Reconciliation report provides both summarized and
                        detailed reconciling data for review. The Summary report lets you
                        see receivables and accounting beginning and ending balances, as well
                        as summarized activity for the period and how this activity was accounted.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Drill down on any amount in the Summary report <span class="uicontrol">Difference</span> column to display the Differences
                        Detail report for that item. The Differences Detail reports display
                        the details that make up balances from the Summary report, and indicate
                        potential causes for differences between actual and reconciling amounts.
                     </p>
                     
                     <div class="infobox-"><span class="notep1">Note: </span>
                        For a more efficient reconciliation, don't allow general
                        ledger sources other than Oracle Fusion Receivables to post to Receivables
                        accounts.

                     <p>If you restrict the number of general ledger accounts
                        that you include in a run of the Prepare Receivables to General Ledger
                        Reconciliation program, this can affect the display of data in the
                        detail reports and may be the cause of a difference between the accounted
                        amount of a transaction and the reconciling amount.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, if Receivables transactions are recorded
                        against balancing segment values 1, 2, 3 or natural accounts A, B,
                        C, and the account range you used excluded some of these values, then
                        these transactions would show up as differences on the report.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you are downloading a large amount of data from
                        the report to a spreadsheet and you plan to perform a number of data
                        manipulations, use the CSV format. If you are downloading data for
                        reference purposes only, use the Excel or PDF format.

                           with the financial category of Accounts Receivable assigned, then
                           these receipts appear as a difference that is outside the account
                           range of the report. In this case, you may wish to re-run the extract
                           and exclude these items.

                        <p>The Non-Receivables Begin Balance amount is any portion
                           of a general ledger account beginning balance that didn't originate
                           from Receivables transactions. You can drill down on this amount to
                           see a list of general ledger journal lines that have an accounting
                           date that falls within the current fiscal year but prior to the period
                           of the reconciliation report; and that have an account combination
                           that falls within the account range of the report.

                           journal lines dated in previous fiscal years, which means that these
                           journal lines won't match the Non-Receivables Begin Balance amount.
                           The drilldown page is only intended to provide current fiscal year
                           journals that might have posted erroneously to the receivables account.

                        <p>The journal source of these journals is typically
                           not Receivables. However, you may see manual subledger journal entries
                           that were entered for the Receivables source directly into the subledger
                           but not necessarily linked to a specific Receivables transaction.
                           Most of these entries represent adjustment journal entries.

                           and become part of the Non-Receivables Begin Balance amount in subsequent
                           periods. Manual general ledger journals that may affect receivables
                           accounts are created directly in the general ledger and don't display
                           under Other Accounting on the Summary report, but display instead
                           under the Non-Receivables Activity amount.

                                 Aging by Account report. If the reconciliation extract either excludes
                                 intercompany transactions or displays intercompany transactions only,
                                 then the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation report and the

                                 In this case, compare the Accounting End Balance with the Receivables
                                 Aging by Account report. You will need to subtract out any amount
                                 in Other Accounting, as this is not included in the Receivables Aging

                           receipts, and/or on-account items, from reconciliation, set the <span class="uicontrol">Include Unapplied and Unidentified Receipts</span> parameter and the <span class="uicontrol">Include On-Account Items</span> parameter to No, and exclude the respective ranges of accounts from
                           the extract. To avoid reconciling differences, unapplied and unidentified
                           receipts, and on-account items, should not post to the same general
                           ledger accounts as that used for transactions. If they do, then the
                           accounting for transactions would also be excluded.

                           Application net to zero, because both sides of the creation of bills

                           the case of canceled bills, are recorded here. Creation and Acceptance
                           require the assignment of transactions to the bill receivable, so
                           each of these bills display the associated transaction applications.
                           Cancellation reverses the bill receivable and its applications, so
                           canceled bills display both sides of the activity, application and
                           unapplication.

                           bills receivable have an accounting impact only because, as the bill
                           goes through its lifecycle, only the account it posts to changes.
                           These events display in the Summary report under Other Accounting.
                           Like all other events related to reconciliation, the accounts used
                           for these activities need to have the financial category of Accounts
                           Receivable assigned to the natural account segment in the chart of
                           accounts.

                        <p>Other activities against bills receivable are included
                           in existing sections of the Summary report and the related drilldown
                           reports. On-account credit memos against a bill receivable display
                           in the Invoices section, along with all other transaction activity.
                           Receipts applied to bills receivable display with other receipts in

                     <p>Periodically you need to reconcile the transactions
                        in your accounts receivable system, both before and after you post
                        to the general ledger. The Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation
                        extract and report help to simplify this process and reduce the amount
                        of manual reconciling activity required.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The automated activities in the reconciliation process
                        function according to the way you set up your Financials environment.
                        A review of some of these setups can help improve the overall reconciliation
                        process.

                        <p>If you implicitly map primary balancing segment values
                           to your business unit, you can reconcile based on business unit. This
                           allows employees from different business units to balance their respective
                           organization activity.

                           case, you will need access to all business units associated with the
                           ledger to perform a thorough reconciliation.

                           Implicit mapping means that there is no specific setup
                           in the system to assign the business unit to a primary balancing segment.
                           This is a business decision, and your setup in Receivables should
                           be such that the default accounting assigned to activities for that
                           business unit should be the primary balancing segment value that was
                           decided.

                        <p>You must assign the financial category of Accounts
                           Receivable to all of your receivables natural account values. This
                           is a required setup step for Receivables to general ledger reconciliation.
                           You perform this task under the Manage Chart of Accounts Value Sets
                           activity.

                           Ledger Reconciliation report won't select any data. When you run the
                           extract program, if you try to select general ledger natural account
                           values that don't have this category assigned, the extract program
                           displays an error indicating that the financial category was not assigned.

                        <p>Once you assign the Accounts Receivable financial
                           category, you can leave the <span class="uicontrol">Account</span> parameter blank when you run the extract, in order to include all
                           accounts that have the Accounts Receivable financial category in the
                           ledger. You can alternatively enter specific natural account values
                           to limit the report to reconciling only a subset of the receivables
                           accounts in the ledger, but these values must have the Accounts Receivable
                           financial category assigned.

                           in order to include them in reconciliation. If you want to exclude
                           these accounts during reconciliation, then you must exclude them from
                           the <span class="uicontrol">Account</span> parameter, and both

                           for transactions would also be excluded, causing reconciling differences.

                           data extract requests in the table older than the number of days specified

                           on January 1, and the value of this profile option is set to 30 days,
                           then the data from January 1 is not purged if you run another extract
                           on January 29. However, the data is purged if you run another extract
                           on February 1.

                        <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Zero Amount Journal Lines
                              Displayed</span> profile option affects whether journal lines
                           with zero amounts display in the Not Transferred to GL Detail report.
                           If this profile option is set to Yes, the Summary report may equal
                           zero and the detail report will list these zero amount journal lines.
                           This doesn't prevent Period Close and doesn't cause reconciling issues
                           as the net effect on the report is zero.

                        <p>Segment security applies to Detail reports only. If
                           you don't have segment security access, then summary and detail report

                        <p>Typically General Ledger users are secured by a data

                                 set, as well as the Receivables and Subledger Accounting data for
                                 all business units linked to the ledger.

                        <p>This doesn't present a problem for the Receivables
                           to General Ledger Reconciliation report if there is an implicit mapping
                           between business units and balancing segment values. Users can simply
                           filter the report for the balancing segment values that are mapped
                           to the business units to which they have access, and the report should
                           work properly.

                           mapping between balancing segment values and business units, then
                           this can cause the Receivables to General Ledger Reconciliation report

                                 data are limited to the business units to which a user is granted
                                 access.

                              <p>For Receivables users, the report
                                 either won't include any general ledger data, or it will include general
                                 ledger data that is not properly mapped to the Receivables and Subledger
                                 Accounting data for the business unit.

                        <p>You can resolve this issue by removing the FND grants
                           from specific business units for the General Ledger job roles, and
                           from specific data access sets for the Receivables job roles.

                                 select an Open period for reconciliation, users can still enter activity
                                 against the period after the extract runs, creating potential discrepancies
                                 between the summary and detail information on the report. Best practice
                                 is to close the accounting period to be reconciled before you run
                                 the extract, and then select this Closed period in the <span class="uicontrol">Accounting Period</span> parameter.

                           corruption in the Receivables tables. An accounting variance is the
                           result of data corruption either in subledger accounting or the general
                           ledger. Variance amounts don't display in any other section of the

                           On-account credit memo refund amounts and on-account
                           credit memo gain or loss amounts are included in the Invoices section
                           of the Reconciliation report, because they affect the open balance
                           of the receivable amount of the credit memo. In all cases the intent
                           is to close the credit memo, so both the original credit memo and
                           the activity against it are displayed.

                        <p>If your business unit is implicitly mapped to the
                           primary balancing segment value in the chart of accounts, you can
                           run the report to reconcile by either business unit or ledger. If
                           there is no implicit mapping, then you must reconcile by ledger.
