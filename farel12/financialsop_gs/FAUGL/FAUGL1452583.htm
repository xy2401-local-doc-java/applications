                     <p>The Close Monitor indicates the number of the subunits
                        by module for the ledgers. It also displays the fractional indicator,

                     <p>Secondary ledgers, journal level, or transaction level

                        units for Payables, Receivables, and Projects. As such, if the ledger
                        set displayed in the hierarchy includes members that are secondary
                        ledgers, journal, or subledger level reporting currencies, the period
                        status indicated in the Close Monitor for such subledger modules is
                        based on its related primary ledger. Asset books and cost organization
                        books can be associated with all types of ledgers. Therefore in the
                        case of the Assets and Costing modules, their period status for secondary
                        ledger or reporting currencies is shown accordingly for the books

                     <p>The revaluation process is used to adjust
                        account balances denominated in a foreign currency. Revaluation adjustments
                        represent the difference in account balances due to changes in conversion
                        rates between the date of the original journal and the revaluation
                        date. These adjustments are posted through journal entries to the
                        underlying account with the offset posted to an unrealized gain or
                        loss account. All debit adjustments are offset against the unrealized
                        gain account and all credit adjustments are offset against the unrealized
                        loss account. If the same account is specified in the <span class="uicontrol">Unrealized Gain Account</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Unrealized Loss Account</span> fields, the net of
                        the adjustments is derived and posted.

                     <p>For balance sheet accounts, the revaluation journal
                        entries are reversed in the next period. AutoReverse can be used to
                        automate the reversals. For income statement accounts that use the
                        PTD method of revaluation, the revaluation journals aren't reversed
                        since each period's revaluation adjustment is for that period.

                     <p>When you run revaluation on your income statement
                        accounts, the process produces two separate journal entries; one that
                        revalues your balance sheet accounts and another for your income statement
                        accounts. You do not reverse the PTD revaluation journal for your
                        income statement accounts in the subsequent period. The revaluation
                        only applies to last period's activity.

                        This functionality only applies when the range of
                        accounts in the revaluation definition consist of income statement
                        and balance sheet accounts. Normally only balance sheets accounts
                        are revalued.

                     <h3>Revaluing Across Multiple Balancing Segments: Worked Example</h3>
                     <p>This example demonstrates how to revalue foreign
                        currency balances across multiple balancing segments. Your company,
                        InFusion America, Inc. has three lines of business. You revalue your
                        foreign currency account balances for two of your divisions, Air Components
                        and Repair Parts. Your Installation Services line of business does
                        not have foreign currency transactions. Your company is your primary
                        balancing segment and your lines of business are represented in your
                        secondary balancing segment.

                                 when the revaluation definition is created because the ledger context
                                 is not known at the time of definition.

                     <p>Reporting currencies are representations
                        of a primary or secondary ledger in another currency. Reporting currencies
                        share the same chart of accounts, accounting calendar, and accounting
                        method as their related ledger. You can use reporting currencies for
                        online inquires, reporting, and consolidation.

                     <p>When you create a reporting currency, you select

                        information that's copied from the ledger to the reporting currency.
                        If you set the currency conversion level to <span class="uicontrol">Balance</span>, the <span class="uicontrol">Translate General

                     <p>In this example, a Canadian
                        company has a Mexican subsidiary. The translation process is run on
                        the subsidiary ledger to convert balances from the Mexican peso (MXP)
                        to the Canadian dollar (CAD).

                              <p>The period end rate of 0.75 translates
                                 100,000 MXP in assets to 75,000 CAD, and translates 60,000 MXP in
                                 liabilities to 45,000 CAD.

                              <p>The historical rate of 0.70 translates

                        you change rates or post additional journal entries. However, some
                        accounting configuration changes require that you delete all previously
                        translated balances, rebuild the balances cube, and rerun the translation
                        process after making the accounting configuration change.

                     <p>If the changes listed in the following table are

                        whether all translated periods, balancing segment values, and related
                        balance level reporting currencies are affected.

                     <p>Account groups are easy-to-use reporting
                        components that save queries on account balances that require regular
                        monitoring. With Account Groups, you define tolerance rules to create
                        self-monitoring accounts. Tolerance rules are set using criteria comparing
                        two balances. The comparison looks for an increase or decrease that
                        is above or below a percentage or constant amount threshold. When
                        the criteria are met, the Account Monitor, General Accounting Infolets,
                        and Financial Reporting Center display the balance information for
                        the account specified.

                     <p>The output from your rules is displayed on the Financial
                        Reporting Center, Account Monitor region on the General Accounting
                        Dashboard, or in General Accounting Infolets. Any accounts that exceed
                        your tolerance limits are automatically displayed. Using the Account
                        Monitor eliminates surprises of account anomalies during your close
                        process. With the Account Monitor you can:

                     <p>Best practice is to have the same chart of accounts
                        across ledgers. Then you can potentially use the same account group
                        across your ledgers as account groups are chart of accounts driven.
                        If you do not want to use an account for all ledgers, add the specific
                        ledger to each account group row. If you enable the <span class="uicontrol">Dynamically derive ledger </span> option when setting
                        up the account group:
                     </p>

                                 or allocations pools. In the Account Monitor, you can also select
                                 one of the infolet account groups to display in the Account Monitor.

                        <p>Payables and Receivables enable you to quickly reconcile
                           these subledgers to your General Ledger. Compare the open payables
                           and receivables balances in the subledger modules to their corresponding
                           account balance in your general ledger for a given accounting period.
                           If discrepancies exist, the process of matching each transaction to
                           its respective accounting entry is automatically performed. The process
                           finds all transactions and accounting entries that contributed to
                           the out of balance situation.

                        attributes: Ledger, Period Name, Period Start Date, and Period End
                        Date. You also configure the enablement method of the social object.

                     <h3>Creating a Conversation with GL Journals: Points to Consider</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>You can create conversations on general ledger
                        journals in Oracle Social Network. For example, when the approver
                        of a journal needs more details from the creator of the journal, the
                        approver creates a journal conversation. This conversation allows
                        communication between the creator and the approver, as well as others
                        who have pertinent information and are added as members to the conversation.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Other points to consider in creating conversations
                        on general ledger journals are:

                        <li>
                           <p>Including other members or adding
                              documents to the conversation.

                        The journal approval flow has an action <span class="uicontrol">Request Information</span> which the approver can
                        use to request the submitter of the batch to provide additional information.
                        Using this action provides a record in the approval flow history.

                        fiscal year, it closes only that period's balance. The best practice
                        is to run the process in the last period of the fiscal year to create
                        an auditable journal entry.

                     <p>After running the Create Income Statement Closing
                        Journal process, you can open the next fiscal year by running the
                        Open Period program. If you run the process:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ul>

                              don't reverse the journal. The act of opening the fiscal year would
                              have achieved the same effect as the journal entry by moving the income
                              statement account balances to the retained earnings account.
                           </p>

                              reverse the journal after you run the reports that show the closed
                              out income statement balances. The journal reversal reinstates your
                              year-to-date income statement balances for the next period.
                           </p>
                        </li>

                        The process closes only actual balances. You can't
                        close budget or encumbrance balances.

                        If you use secondary ledgers or reporting currencies,
                        you must define a conversion rule to prevent replication of your year-end
                        closing journals from your primary ledger. Replication can cause unbalanced
                        journal entries if different currencies and conversion rates are used
                        in the ledgers. Instead, run your closing journal processes directly
                        in your reporting or secondary ledgers to ensure that the balances
                        are reduced to zero.

                     <p>Many countries follow specific procedures
                        to generate journal entries to close and open fiscal years. These
                        year-end entries apply to both the income statement and balance sheet
                        accounts. Auditable closing procedures vary based on country's reporting
                        requirements and an organization's business needs.

                     <p>Oracle Fusion General Ledger provides two processes
                        for the year-end closing journals. These processes close the accounts
                        by putting the sum of the debits in the credit and vice versa. For
                        many European countries, including Italy, Spain, France, Belgium,
                        Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the accounts must be closed by recording
                        the difference between the total debits and total credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Poland is different and requires year-end income
                        statement as a net closing journal and balance sheet closing journal
                        to be in accumulated balances.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The closing journals processes meet the Italian and
                        other European countries legal requirements.

                        a ledger and its associated reporting currencies simultaneously by
                        grouping them into a ledger set. The result is a journal batch for
                        each ledger, reporting currency, and entered currency. You can also
                        run the process separately for each ledger and reporting currency.
