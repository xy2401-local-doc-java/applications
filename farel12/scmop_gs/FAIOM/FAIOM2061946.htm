                     <p>It is recommended that you identify the features
                        that you must implement to support the order-to-cash flow in your business
                        environment, and then estimate the effort required to set them up.

                           Implementing Order-to-Cash: Roadmap. This work will provide a solid
                           understanding of the features that you need to implement, and the
                           work involved in setting them up.

                           For example, if your implementation will require the configurator
                           and order import, then include the setup effort for them in your project
                           plans, and consider whether or not you must administer the job roles
                           that support them.

                     <p>This road map provides a high-level procedure
                        that you can use to implement order-to-cash. You perform the
                        common setup tasks, set up integration, set up parameters, and so
                        on.

                              primarily reference tasks that reside in the Orders functional area.
                              Complete each of these tasks, as necessary, depending on your business
                              requirements.
                           </p>

                        <li>
                           <p> To perform a task, click each
                              task in the Orders area. If the Orders area does not display a task,
                              then search for it in the Search Tasks field.
                           </p>

                           <p>The work you must perform depends
                              on your business requirements. For example, a typical implementation
                              requires that you perform most or all of the tasks that integrate
                              Order Management. However, whether or not you perform other tasks
                              depend on your business requirements, such as tasks that control order
                              status, constrain changes, or that customize orchestration processes.

                              that reside in the guide titled Oracle SCM Cloud, Implementing Order
                              Management. It is recommended that you use these topics when you perform
                              the task that they describe.

                        <li>
                           <p>The Prepare column describes work
                              that you can do to prepare for the implementation. It is recommended
                              that you perform this work before you administer order-to-cash. Doing
                              so will help to avoid interruption and downtime during administration,
                              and will help to make sure it goes smoothly. You can also use the
                              Prepare column to check off preparation work as you complete it.

                                    <p>A pilot implementation expects
                                       your test orders to use the same values for the unit of measure, currency,
                                       and currency conversion that you collect into the data repository.
                                       During a full implementation, if multiple order capture systems use
                                       different values for these entities, then you must perform more implementation
                                       steps. For example, if one order capture system uses Ea for each item,
                                       and if another order capture system uses Each for each item, then
                                       you must perform more steps to implement the data cross-referencing
                                       that these order capture systems require.

                                    <p>Your implementation can collect
                                       reference data from multiple systems. However, a reference data entity
                                       is a global object, so Order Management and Global Order Promising
                                       uses the most recent data that your implementation collects. It is
                                       recommended that you identify the source system that contains the
                                       master data list, and then collect data from this source system after
                                       you collect data from all other source systems. For example, if source
                                       system B contains the master list of currencies, then collect currencies
                                       from source system A so that Order Management can cross-reference
                                       currencies to system A, and then collect currencies from system B.

                                       and a destination, then you must collect shipping methods. If you
                                       do not collect them, then Order Management uses a transit time of
                                       zero days.

                        These decisions determine the offerings and functional areas you want
                        to implement. You then configure the offerings and functional areas
                        that support the activities your organization or company performs.
                        During the configuration process, you specifically enable offerings
                        and functional areas for use before you implement them.

                     <p>Order Management Cloud provides a central
                        order hub in a multichannel environment that you can use to improve
                        order capture and order fulfillment in the order-to-cash process when communicating sales orders between
                        businesses. Business-to-business messaging uses Collaboration Messaging
                        Framework to automate message flow so that Order Management can receive
                        and process source
                        orders from trading partners, and then reply with an advance shipment
                        notice after shipping successfully finishes.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Web services use Open Applications Group Integration
                        Specification (OAGIS) messages in the payload that it uses to handle
                        the interactions that occur between Oracle Cloud Applications and
                        trading partners. You can use your existing Electronic Data Interchange
                        (EDI) infrastructure with OAGIS. This configuration provides you the
                        flexibility to receive each source order and allow a trading partner
                        and supplier to process it through order fulfillment.

                     <p>Drop ship is a supply chain management technique where the
                        seller relies on a supplier or contract manufacturer to build, store,
                        and ship each sales order to the customer. The retailer does not maintain
                        an inventory of the goods that each sales order references. You can
                        use Order Management Cloud to automate this process.

                        <p>Assume your customer places an order with
                           you that requires a drop ship. Order Management sends a purchase request
                           to Procurement, which places a purchase order with your supplier,
                           and then your supplier ships directly to your customer. You provide
                           a purchase order for the item and instructions that describe how to
                           ship directly to the customer. The supplier or contract manufacturer
                           ships the item, and your company earns a profit.

                     <p>You can use Order Management Cloud to manage
                        the flow of information through the systems and business functions
                        that it uses to run the drop ship flow. This topic describes the systems and functions
                        involved.

                     <p>The following diagram illustrates how Order Management
                        runs a drop ship flow. Each horizontal row in this diagram represents
                        a system or business function that this flow uses. The drop ship flow
                        is a variation of the order-to-cash flow. For details, see Order-to-Cash: How It
                        Works.

                     <p>You can modify how Order Management performs some
                        of these steps. For example, you can use Manage Sourcing Rules to
                        modify how Global Order Promising considers sourcing rules, you can
                        use Manage Drop Ship Financial Flows to modify how Supply Chain Financial
                        Orchestration runs the financial flow, and so on. For details, see

                              in Order Management assigns an orchestration process to
                              the sales order, uses the Schedule Order task to start the scheduling
                              work for this sales order, and then sends a scheduling request to
                              Global Order Promising Cloud.

                              site that can fulfill the order in the most efficient way. If the sales
                              order specifies a supplier, then Global Order Promising uses this
                              supplier.

                        <p>Oracle Fusion Purchasing allows your buyer to create
                           a blanket
                           purchase agreement for the items that it will drop ship from
                           a supplier. You must define an agreement for each supplier and supplier
                           site, and associate one or more items with this agreement. You do
                           this work when you set up purchasing. This topic describes how to
                           modify this setup so that it supports drop ship. Purchasing uses the
                           prices that the agreement specifies to set default values in the purchase
                           documents. For details, see Blanket Purchase Agreement Lines: Points
                           to Consider.

                        the requisition
                        business unit. The financial flow allows you to create cost
                        accounting distributions that track the costs and ownership liability

                        necessary.

                        <p>Financial Orchestration Cloud allows you to set up
                           and run the financial flow according to ownership transfers that occur
                           between the parties that are involved in the drop ship flow. You can

                           unit and the receiving business unit. Financial Orchestration uses
                           this relationship when it creates a purchase requisition for a drop
                           shipment.

                           determines whether or not this flow exists when you create this relationship.

                           uses this procurement financial flow when it does financial orchestration
                           for the drop ship. For example, assume you must create a requisition
                           that references China for each item that resides in the Metal category,
                           and create a requisition that references the United States for each
                           item that  resides in the Plastic category. In this situation, you
                           can create drop ship financial flows that use the following configuration.

                     <p>To specify the event that indicates the ownership
                        change, you can specify to use the receipt of the advanced shipment notice (ASN) from the supplier, or to use the arrival and entry of the
                        accounts payable invoice. You specify these values in the Supplier
                        Ownership Change Event field on the Manage Drop Ship Financial Flows

                        <p>If the supplier site sends an advanced shipment notice
                           (ASN), then it is recommended that you set the Supplier Ownership
                           Change Event field to ASN From Supplier.  The arrival of the advanced
                           shipment notice starts the downstream processes that cost and bill
                           the shipment, including creating the drop ship receipts, starting
                           the billing processes, and starting the financial orchestration process
                           for the drop ship order. Order Management Cloud loads the advanced
                           shipment notice into the Receiving component, which creates a type
                           of drop ship flow known as <span class="uicontrol">receipt and delivery</span> that records an event.  Receiving sends this event to Financial
                           Orchestration and Order Management. Financial Orchestration uses the
                           status information and details that this event contains to start financial
                           orchestration processes. These processes perform trade transactions
                           in costing, process intercompany receivable invoices, process intercompany
                           payable invoices, and so on. Order Management uses this information
                           to start billing processes and order orchestration processes.

                        <p>If the supplier site does not send an advanced shipment
                           notice, then it is recommended that you set the Supplier Ownership
                           Change Event field to AP Invoice Match. Financial Orchestration receives
                           the events that are related to the accounts payable invoice from Accounts
                           Payable, and then uses one of these events to start the financial
                           orchestration processes and to inform the receiving process. The arrival
                           and entry of the accounts payable invoice starts the downstream processes
                           that cost and bill the shipment. The receiving process works the same
                           way that it does for ASN From Supplier, except the process never creates
                           an advanced shipment notice.  Order Management creates the receipt
                           and delivery drop ship when it creates the accounts payable invoice
                           for the purchase order that the drop ship references.

                     <p>To allow your users to drop ship a configured item, you must
                        define an agreement for the configuration model that specifies the configured item and
                        for the optional components that might be part of the configure-to-order
                        shipment. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>A hybrid configuration model is a type of configuration model
                        that includes an assemble-to-order configuration model as the child
                        and a purchase-to-order configuration model as the parent. Order Management
                        Cloud uses one blanket purchase agreement to source the assemble-to-order components, and a different blanket
                        purchase agreement to source the purchase-to-order components. So,
                        Order Management issues separate purchase orders to the supplier.
