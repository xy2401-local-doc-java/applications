<div>
<p>From <span>Oracle BI Applications</span> release 11.1.1.7.1 onward, Project Analytics includes a subject area to analyze Project Resource Management.</p>
<p>This subject area comes with over 230 metrics and the catalog includes five new dashboard pages and over 40 new reports. For details, refer to the Oracle BI Applications Metrics guides on My Oracle Support.</p>
<p>This release supports E-Business Suite 11.5.10 and R12x, and PeopleSoft 9x.</p>
<p>The following are the areas of analysis that this subject area supports and the fact tables that were introduced in <span>Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse</span>.</p>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Project Requirements</p>
<p>Table W_PROJ_RSRC_RQRMNT_F stores the detail about project requirements, including metrics such as time and number of resources requested and unfulfilled by project requirement. The fact table stores the requirement at the grain of requirement date range. Requirements are captured for a range of days in the ERP, but to provide the ability to compare requirements to Capacity at daily grain, the requirement hours is distributed linearly among the days within that range in the BI metadata repository (that is, the RPD file).</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Resource Utilization</p>
<p>Table W_PROJ_RSRC_UTILIZATION_F stores the details about resource assignments for each assigned day as well as resource capacity for each valid business day for each resource. This fact includes metrics such as capacity, scheduled, available and unassigned time. Actual Utilization is also supported via Project Cost fact.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Competencies and Jobs</p>
<p>Table W_EMP_JOB_F stores the details about the employee's primary job. Table W_EMP_COMPETENCY_F stores the detail about the employee's competencies. The repository introduces a new logical table source that uses the above two facts to provide the ability to compare supply vs demand of jobs and competencies. This fact includes metrics such as # Of Employees, # Of Employees MAGO etc.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead3">Resource Availability</p>
<p>This star provides the ability to find resources available for a pre-determined number of consecutive business days. There is no physical table for this fact in the warehouse. It is an opaque view in the BI metadata repository (that is, the RPD file).</p>
<p>This opaque view is a select query which makes use of Employee's Holiday information and the Employee's assignment information to calculate the availability. This fact includes metrics such as Available Resource Count for Bucket1 etc.</p>
<p>This new subject area requires the parameters listed below to be set at implementation time. These are FSM parameters which are used by both EBS and PSFT adaptors. These parameters need to be configured in FSM.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Project Resource Management Capacity Records Creation Period: This parameter is used to determine for how long (in months) the capacity records are created. The default value of the this parameter is 12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Availability Bucket Size: This parameter is used to specify the number of consecutive available business days used in the search for resources. The default value for this parameter is 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Resource Management UOM: The repository variable PROJ_RSRC_MNGMT_UOM specifies the unit of the reporting. This can be: HOURS, DAYS or FTE. The default value for this parameter is 'HOURS'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project Resource Management Value of Unit of Measure in Days: Value of Unit of Measure in Days expressed in hours. This specifies the number of hours in a business day. The default value for this parameter is 8.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<div class="section">
<p class="subhead2">Cross Fact Analysis</p>
<p>The Canonical BU (Canonical Organization) is the Common Logical BU (Organization) against which data is analyzed across different fact tables. From each fact table one main BU (Org) is selected to be used for analyzing data in that fact table (for example, for Cost Fact, the canonical BU is the Expenditure BU; for Revenue Fact, the canonical BU is the Contact BU) and use the corresponding foreign key to join to the logical dimension Dim - Business Unit (Dim - Project Organization). These dimensions Dim - Business Unit and Dim - Project Organization are called Canonical BU and Canonical Project Organizations dimensions respectively. For example, for the Cost Fact the join would be</p>
<p><code class="codeph">Dim_W_INT_ORG_D_Business_Unit.SCD1_WID = Fact_W_PROJ_COST_LINE_F_Project_Cost.EXPENDITURE_OPER_UNIT_WID</code></p>
<p>For Revenue Fact the join would be:</p>
<p><code class="codeph">Dim_W_INT_ORG_D_Business_Unit.SCD1_WID =Fact_W_PROJ_REVENUE_LINE_F_Revenue_Lines.CONTRACT_BU_WID</code></p>
<p>In addition the Canonical BU calendar is used when forming the foreign key to the Fiscal Calendar Day dimension (W_MCAL_DAY_D).For Cross Fact Analysis, you must always ensure that you have a filter on Canonical BU ( Business Unit Name column under Organizations folder in presentation area). This filter on Canonical BU is required in all dashboards because it ensures the calendar is unique and prevents double counting.</p>
<p>The table lists the Canonical BU (Canonical Organizations) that are available for the Logical Facts supported in Project Analytics solution.</p>

<div>
<p>The Budgetary Control dashboard is targeted at executives managing overall budgets and senior level managers managing budgets by cost centers, funds, programs, projects and accounts. It is designed to provide key analysis pertaining to expense budgets including budget amounts, encumbrances and expenditures as well as revenue budgets including budget amounts and recognized revenues.</p>
<p>There are some prerequisites to meet in order to use Budgetary Control Analytics:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Budgetary Control Analytics dashboards allows drill down from summary reports to detail reports on purchase orders, purchase requisitions etc. which fall under Procurement and Spend Analytics subject areas. So, in order for these drill downs to work, you must license and implement Procurement and Spend Analytics offering in addition to the Financial Analytics offering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PeopleSoft customers, commercial or public sector, need to implement Commitment Control module in the PeopleSoft Applications to use Budgetary Control Analytics.</p>

<p>* PeopleSoft uses frequency lookup table PS_FREQUENCY_TBL (annual factors / 12) for this calculation</p>
<p>The source domain WORK_HRS_FREQ is loaded with all the working hours frequency units defined in the source system, for example, Monthly, Weekly, Bi-Weekly.</p>
<p>The target domains are seeded with a number of conversion factors for the common frequency units, for example 0.2 is seeded for converting e.g. 40 hours per week into 40 * 0.2 = 8 hours per day.</p>
<p>The target domains may be extended if additional conversion factors are required. For example, if a unit of Tri-weekly was used to define how many hours are normally worked in a three week period, then assuming a 5 day week, the following new frequencies should be added to the target domains (assumed number format is 999.999999999):</p>

<p>In the domain mappings, Tri-weekly source units would be mapped to these corresponding new target members.</p>
<p>Therefore, an employee who works 120 hours tri-weekly would appear as follows in the fact metrics:</p>
<p>- Standard monthly hours: 120 * 1.444444444 = 173.3333333331585</p>
<p>- Standard daily hours: 20 * 0.066666667 = 8</p>
