<div>
<p>You can map from source Payroll balances/earnings/deductions/taxes to the <span>Oracle Business Analytics Warehouse</span> Payroll summary measures through the use of domain values.</p>
<div class="section">
<p>HR Analytics Payroll model has two fact tables, the detailed fact table and the summary fact table. The detailed fact table has all the balances (in case of EBS Payroll) and Earnings/Deductions/Taxes (In case of PeopleSoft North American and Global Payroll) extracted from the source system on separate rows. This table will be used for detail reports and ad-hoc analysis.</p>
<p>To support analytic reporting, the summary fact table delivers a set of default summary measures. Source payroll balances are mapped to the summary measures and loaded into summary fact table. More than one payroll balance can be mapped to a summary metric, in which case the individual source balances will be summed to form a summary measure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="GUID-E2FF7AEF-E758-4FBB-9097-CE5B8CFFCDAC__GUID-236230F4-1DC2-456B-A91B-40BA6A476939"><img width="714" height="417" src="img/GUID-8A415DCA-F1B7-44A3-869C-6125393534B7-default.gif" alt="Description of GUID-8A415DCA-F1B7-44A3-869C-6125393534B7-default.gif follows" title="Description of GUID-8A415DCA-F1B7-44A3-869C-6125393534B7-default.gif follows" /><br />

<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>If, Base Pay constitutes Regular Salary, Total Earnings constitutes Regular Salary and Bonus and Total Tax constitutes Income Tax and Social Insurance Tax.</p>
<p>The source to target balance mapping should be done accordingly as shown below.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>Regular Salary is mapped to Pay_Base and Total Earnings summary measures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonus is mapped to Total Earnings (Total Earnings = Regular Salary + Bonus).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Income Tax and Social Insurance Tax are mapped to Total Tax (Total Tax = Income Tax + Social Insurance Tax).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure additive property of measures, we only support run balances. For each payroll run the actual run balances processed are stored. Because we are not breaking these down by context, we can combine run balances across time to form higher level balances, for example, PTD, MTD, and YTD.</p>
<p>If the source balance mapping to the summary measures are not done in the <span>Configuration Manager</span>, the Payroll Summary Fact table will not be loaded with any data and this will cause the reports based on the summary fact table to return no data.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="section" -->

<p>Source payroll balances can be mapped to the target summary measures in two ways:</p>
<p>- One to One Mapping (using W_PAY_BALANCE domain).</p>
<p>- Many to One Mapping (using W_PAY_MAP_FACTOR_xxxx domain).</p>
<p>In one-to-one mapping, a source balance is directly mapped to a summary measure in <span>Configuration Manager</span>.</p>
<p>For example: If you have a source balance called Base Pay, you can map it to PAY_BASE summary measure code in the <span>Configuration Manager</span> using the Domain Mappings.</p>
<p>If you have multiple source balances Earns1, Earns2 that constitute a summary measure PAY_BASE, you can map multiple source balances to a single summary measure.</p>
<p>The source balances will be aggregated to populate the summary measure.</p>
<p>PAY_BASE = Earns1 + Earns2</p>

<p>In this screen, you can map the source balances to the balance multiplier. For example: If NET_PAY is calculated as Earns1 + Earns2 &ndash; Ded1 &ndash; Ded2, then Source Earns1 is mapped to 1, Earns2 is mapped to 1, Ded1 is mapped to &ndash;1 and Ded2 is mapped to &ndash;1. For each employee, per pay period, the NET_PAY is calculated with the above formula and loaded into PAY_NET column of the Payroll Summary Fact table.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li class="stepexpand"><span>Run the Main Load Plan to extract the balances from source to warehouse.</span>
<div>
<p>The identified balances are loaded into Payroll detail fact table as separate rows. The Summary Measures are loaded in the summary fact table as per the mapping done in step 3.</p>
