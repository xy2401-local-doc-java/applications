<p><span>Smart Forms</span> start with an ad hoc grid, created either by opening an <span>Oracle Planning and Budgeting Cloud</span>, <span>Oracle Financial Consolidation and Close Cloud</span>, or <span>Oracle Tax Reporting Cloud</span>form for ad hoc analysis or by starting ad hoc analysis at the Plan type level, as shown in <a href="smartforms_example.htm#smartforms_2__smartforms_3">Figure 12-1</a>.</p>

<p>Add a row by typing <span class="q">"entity2"</span> for the Entity dimension, and the label &ldquo;accountX&rdquo; for the Account dimension on row 13, cells A13 and B13, creating on the row two grid labels. Cells C13:F13 will be calculated cells. In order to be used as grid labels, the member names <span class="q">"entity2"</span> and <span class="q">"accountX"</span> should not exist in any dimension and there should not be any alias with the same name in any alias table. However, note that in the basic ad hoc above, entity2 is a member name, so entity2 will be treated as a member.</p>

<p class="subhead1">Notes</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>
<p>You must enter grid labels in order to save an ad hoc grid with business calculations in the form of Excel formulas and functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an empty space is entered instead of a grid label, the grid behavior is determined by generic ad hoc rules, such as replacing empty member cell with the same member from this dimension or displaying an error in case the grid becomes malformed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enter grid labels at any dimension location for an axis: innermost, outermost, or any location in the middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can enter business calculations only on rows and columns created by grid labels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may type a member name in a grid label row, but it must be placed within the correct dimension. If the member name is entered out of place, and is already in use by the applicable data provider in another dimension, a message is returned upon Refresh, prompting you to change the label name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can save the ad hoc grid as a <span>Smart Form</span>, as described in <a href="smartforms_creating.htm#smartforms_10">Creating Smart Forms</a>. By doing this, our grid labels and business calculations are also saved to the applicable data provider.</p>
<p>The provider will identify &ldquo;accountX&rdquo; as a grid label on refresh by displaying it as an ad hoc &ldquo;comment&rdquo; row or column (blank cells background). The <span class="q">"entity2"</span> label will take on the same properties as the other entity2 members in the grid, as this member name already exists in the provider database.</p>

<p class="subhead1">Other Examples</p>
<p>Using the Vision sample application, here is an example of a <span>Smart Form</span>, saved from an ad hoc grid, then later opened as a form in <span>Oracle Smart View for Office</span>.</p>
<p>In <a href="smartforms_example.htm#smartforms_2__smartforms_30">Figure 12-5</a>, the business calculation was constructed to show the average gross quarterly profit and average gross total profit for two years, FY13 and FY14. It also shows cell styles applied to the grid label and business calculations cells.</p>
